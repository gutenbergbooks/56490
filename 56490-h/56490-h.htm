<p><span class="smcap">Satirical</span> poetry, whether in the form
of regular satires, or in the more familiar guise of epistles, has
never enjoyed a wide success in Spain. Its spirit, indeed, was known
there from the times of the Archpriest of Hita and Rodrigo Cota, both
of whom seem to have been thoroughly imbued with it. Torres Naharro,
too, in the early part of the sixteenth century, and Silvestre and
Castillejo a little later, still sustained it, and wrote satires in the
short national verse, with much of the earlier freedom, and all the
bitterness, that originally accompanied it.</p>

<p>But after Mendoza and Boscan, in the middle of that<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[p. 4]</span> century, had sent poetical
epistles to one another written in the manner of Horace, though in
the Italian <i>terza rima</i>, the fashion was changed. A rich, strong
invective, such as Castillejo dared to use when he wrote the “Satire
on Women,” which was often reprinted and greatly relished, was almost
entirely laid aside; and a more cultivated and philosophical tone,
suited to the stately times of Charles the Fifth and Philip the Second,
took its place. Montemayor, it is true, and Padilla, with a few wits
of less note, wrote in both manners; but Cantorál with little talent,
Gregorio Murillo with a good deal, and Rey de Artieda in a familiar
style that was more winning than either, took the new direction so
decidedly, that, from the beginning of the seventeenth century, the
change may be considered as substantially settled.<a id="FNanchor_1"
href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>Barahona de Soto was among the earliest that wrote in this new
form, which was a union of the Roman with the Italian. We have four
of his satires, composed after he had served in the Morisco wars;
the first and the last of which, assailing all bad poets, show
plainly the school to which he belonged and the direction he wished
to follow. But his efforts, though seriously made, did not raise him
above an untolerated mediocrity.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2"
class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>A single satire of Jauregui, addressed to Lydia, as if she
might have been the Lydia of Horace, is better.<a id="FNanchor_3"
href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a><span class="pagenum"
id="Page_5">[p. 5]</span> But in the particular style and manner of
the philosophical Horatian satire, none succeeded so well as the two
Argensolas. Their discussions are, it is true, sometimes too grave and
too long; but they give us spirited pictures of the manners of their
times. The sketch of a profligate lady of fashion, for instance, in
the one to Flora, by Lupercio, is excellent, and so are long passages
in two others against a court life, by Bartolomé. All three, however,
are too much protracted, and the last contains a poor repetition of
the fable of the Country Mouse and the City Mouse, in which, as almost
everywhere else, its author’s relations to Horace are apparent.<a
id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>Quevedo, on the other hand, followed Juvenal, whose hard, unsparing
temper was better suited to his own tastes, and to a disposition
embittered by cruel persecutions. But Quevedo is often free and
indecorous, as well as harsh, and offends that sensibility to virtue
which a satirist ought carefully to cultivate. It should, however, be
remembered in his favor, that, though living under the despotism of the
Philips, and crushed by it, no Spanish poet stands before him in the
spirit of an independent and vigorous satire. Góngora approaches him
on some occasions, but Góngora rarely dealt with grave subjects, and
confined his satire almost entirely to burlesque ballads and sonnets,
which he wrote in the fervor of his youth. At no period of his life,
and certainly not after he went to court, would he have hazarded a
satirical epistle like the one on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[p.
6]</span> the decay of Castilian spirit and the corruption of Castilian
manners, which Quevedo had the courage to send to the Count Duke
Olivares, when he was at the height of his influence.<a id="FNanchor_5"
href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>The greatest contemporaries of both of them hardly turned their
thoughts in this direction; for as to Cervantes, his “Journey to
Parnassus” is quite too good-natured an imitation of Caporali to be
classed among satires, even if its form permitted it to be placed
there; and as to Lope de Vega, though some of his sonnets and other
shorter poems are full of spirit and severity, especially those that
pass under the name of Burguillos, still his whole course, and the
popular favor that followed it, naturally prevented him from seeking
occasions to do or say any thing ungracious.</p>

<p>Nor did the state of society at this period favor the advancement,
or even the continuance, of any such spirit. The epistles of Espinel
and Arguijo are, therefore, absolutely grave and solemn; and those of
Rioja, Salcedo, Ulloa, and Melo are not only grave, but are almost
entirely destitute of poetical merit, except one by the first of them,
addressed to Fabio, which, if neither gay nor witty, is an admirably
wise moral rebuke of the folly and irksomeness of depending on royal
favor. Borja is more free, as became his high station, and speaks out
more plainly; but the best of his epistles—the one against a court
life—is not so good as the youthful <i>tercetos</i> on the same subject
by Góngora, nor equal to his own jesting address to his collected
poems. Rebolledo, his only successor of any note at the time, is
moral, but tiresome; and Solís, like the few that followed him, is
too dull to be remembered. In<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[p.
7]</span>deed, if Villegas in his old age, when, perhaps, he had been
soured by disappointment, had not written three satires which he did
not venture to publish, we should have nothing worth notice as we
approach the disheartening close of this long period.<a id="FNanchor_6"
href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>Nearly all the didactic satires and nearly all the satirical
epistles of the best age of Spanish literature are Horatian in their
tone, and written in the Italian <i>terza rima</i>. In general, their spirit
is light, though philosophical,—sometimes it is courtly,—and, taken
together, they have less poetical force and a less decided coloring
than we might claim from the class to which they belong. But they are
frequently graceful and agreeable, and some of them will be oftener
read, for the mere pleasure they bestow, than many in other languages
which are distinguished for greater wit and severity.</p>

<p>The truth, however, is, that wit and severity of this kind and in
this form were never heartily encouraged in Spain. The nation itself
has always been too grave and dignified to ask or endure the censure
they imply; and if such a character as the Spanish has its ridiculous
side, it must be approached by any thing rather than personal satire.
Books like the romances of chivalry may, indeed, be assailed with
effect, as they were by Cervantes; men in classes may be caricatured,
as they are in the Spanish <i>picaresque</i> novels and in the old drama;
and bad poetry may be ridiculed, as it was by half the poets who did
not write it, and by some who did. But the characters of individuals,
and especially<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[p. 8]</span> of
those in high station and of much notoriety, are protected, under such
circumstances, by all the social influences that can be brought to
their defence, and cannot safely be assailed.</p>

<p>Such, at least, was the case in Spain. Poetical satire came there
to be looked upon with distrust, so that it was thought to be hardly
in good taste, or according to the conventions of good society, to
indulge in its composition.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7"
class="fnanchor">[7]</a> And if, with all this, we remember the anxious
nature of the political tyranny which long ruled the country, and
the noiseless, sleepless vigilance of the Inquisition,—both of which
are apparent in the certificates and licenses that usher in whatever
succeeded in finding its way through the press,—we shall have no
difficulty in accounting for the fact, that poetical satire never had
a vigorous and healthy existence in Spain, and that, after the latter
part of the seventeenth century, it almost entirely disappeared till
better times revived it.</p>


<p class="mt2">Elegies, though from their subjects little connected
with satire, are yet, by their measure and manner, connected with
it in Spanish poetry; for both are generally written in the Italian
<i>terza rima</i>, and both are often thrown into the form of epistles.<a
id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> Garcilasso
could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[p. 9]</span> write elegies
in their true spirit; but the second that passes under that name in
his works is merely a familiar epistle to a friend. So is the first by
Figueroa, which is followed by others in a tone more appropriate to
their titles. But all are in the Italian verse and manner, and two of
them in the Italian language. The eleven “Lamentations,” as he calls
them, of Silvestre, are elegiac epistles to his lady-love, written in
the old Castilian measures, and not without the old Castilian poetical
spirit. Cantorál fails; nor can the Argensolas and Borja be said to
have succeeded, though they wrote in different manners, some of which
were scarcely elegiac. Herrera is too lyric—too lofty, perhaps, from
the very nature of his genius—to write good elegies; but some of those
on his love, and one in which he mourns over the passions that survive
the decay of his youth, have certainly both beauty and tenderness.</p>

<p>Rioja, on the contrary, seems to have been of the true temperament,
and to have written elegies from instinct, though he called them
<i>Silvas</i>; while Quevedo, if he were the author of the poems that pass
under the name of the Bachiller de la Torre, must have done violence
to his genius in the composition of ten short pieces, which he calls
<i>Endechas</i>, in Adonian verse, but which read much like imitations of
some of the gentler among the old ballads. If to these we add the
thirteen elegies of Villegas, nearly all of which are epistles, and
one or two of them light and amusing epistles, we shall have what is
most worthy of notice in this small division of Spanish poetry during
the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, that has not been already
considered. From the whole, we should naturally infer that the Spanish
temperament was little fitted to the subdued, simple, and gentle
tone of the proper elegy; a conclusion that is<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_10">[p. 10]</span> undoubtedly true, notwithstanding the
examples of Garcilasso and Rioja, the best and most elegiac portions
of whose poetry do not even bear its name.<a id="FNanchor_9"
href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>


<p class="mt2">Pastoral poetry in Spain is directly connected with
elegiac, through the eclogues of Garcilasso, which unite the attributes
of both. To his school, indeed, including Boscan and Mendoza, we trace
the earliest successful specimens of the more formal Spanish pastoral,
with the characteristics still recognized. But its origin is much
earlier. The climate and condition of the Peninsula, which from a
very remote period had favored the shepherd’s life and his pursuits,
facilitated, no doubt, if they did not occasion, the first introduction
into Spanish poetry of a pastoral tone, whose echoes are heard far
back among the old ballads. But the Italian forms of pastoral verse
were naturalized as soon as they were introduced. Figueroa, Cantorál,
Montemayor, and Saa de Miranda—the last two of whom were Portuguese,
and all of whom visited Italy and lived there—contributed their efforts
to those of Garcilasso and Boscan, by writing Spanish eclogues in the
Italian manner. All had a good degree of success, but none so much as
Saa de Miranda, who was born in 1495, and died in 1558, and who, from
the promptings of his own genius, renounced the profession of the law,
to which he was bred, and the favor of the court, where his prospects
were high, in order to devote himself to poetry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[p. 11]</span>He was the first
of the Portuguese who wrote in the forms introduced by Boscan and
Garcilasso, and none, perhaps, since his time has appeared in them
with more grace and power,—certainly none in the particular form of
eclogues. His pastorals, however, are not all in the new manner. On
the contrary, some of them are in the ancient short verse, and seem
to have been written before he was acquainted with the change that
had just been effected in Spanish poetry. But all of them are in one
spirit, and are marked by a simplicity that well becomes the class of
compositions to which they belong, though it may rarely be found in
them. This is true, both when he writes his beautiful pastoral story
of “The Mondego,” which is in the manner of Garcilasso, and contains
an account of himself addressed to the king; and when he writes his
seventh eclogue, which is in the forms of Enzina and Vicente, and
seems to have been acted amidst the rejoicings of the noble family of
Pereira, after one of their number had returned from military service
against the Turks.</p>

<p>But a love of the country, of country scenery and country
occupations, pervades nearly every thing Saa de Miranda wrote. The very
animals seem to be treated by him with more naturalness and familiarity
than they are elsewhere; and throughout the whole of his poetry, there
is an ease and amenity that show it comes from the heart. Why he wrote
so much in Spanish, it is not now easy to tell. Perhaps he thought
the language more poetical than his native Portuguese, or perhaps he
had merely personal reasons for his preference. But whatever may have
been the cause, six out of his eight eclogues are composed in natural,
flowing Castilian; and the result of the whole is, that, while,
on all accounts, he is placed among the four or five princi<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[p. 12]</span>pal poets of his own
country, he occupies a position of enviable distinction among those
of the prouder nation that soon became, for a time, its masters.<a
id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>Montemayor, Polo, and their followers in prose pastorals, scattered
bucolic verse of all kinds freely through their fictions; and
sometimes, though seldom, they added to the interest and merit of
their stories by this sort of ornament. One of those who had least
success in it was Cervantes; and of those who had most, Balbuena
stands in the first rank. His “Golden Age” contains some of the best
and most original eclogues in the language; written, indeed, rather in
the free, rustic tone of Theocritus, than with the careful finish of
Virgil, but not on that account the less attractive.<a id="FNanchor_11"
href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>Of Luis Barahona de Soto, we possess an eclogue better than any
thing else he has left us;<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12"
class="fnanchor">[12]</a> and of Pedro de Padilla, the friend of
Cervantes and of Silvestre, a remarkable improvisator and a much
loved man, we have a number of pastoral poems which carry with
them a picturesque, antique air, from being made up in part of
ballads and <i>villancicos</i>.<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13"
class="fnanchor">[13]</a> Pedro de Enzinas<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_13">[p. 13]</span> attempted to write religious
eclogues, and failed;<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14"
class="fnanchor">[14]</a> but, in the established forms, Juan de
Morales and Gomez Tapia, who are hardly known except for single
attempts of this kind,<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15"
class="fnanchor">[15]</a> and Vicente Espinel,—among whose eclogues,
that in which a Soldier and a Shepherd discuss the Spanish wars
in Italy is both original and poetical,<a id="FNanchor_16"
href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>—were all successful.</p>

<p>The eclogues of Lope de Vega, of which we have already spoken,
drew after them a train of imitations, like his other popular poetry.
But neither Balvas, nor Villegas, nor Carrillo, nor the Prince of
Esquilache equalled him. Quevedo alone among his compeers, and he
only if he is the author of the poems of the Bachiller de la Torre,
proved himself a rival of the great master, unless we must give an
equal place to Pedro de Espinosa, whose story of “The Genil,” half
elegiac and half pastoral, is the happiest and most original specimen
of that peculiar form of which Boscan in his “Hero and Leander” gave
the first imperfect example.<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17"
class="fnanchor">[17]</a> Pedro Soto de Roxas,—who wrote short lyric
poems with spirit, as well as eclogues,—Zarate, and Ulloa, belong
to the same school, which was continued, by Texada Gomes de los
Reyes, Barrios the Jew, and Inez de la Cruz the Mexican nun, down
to the end of the century. But in all its forms, whether tending to
become too lyrical, as it does in Figueroa, or too narrative, as in
Espinosa,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[p. 14]</span> Spanish
pastoral poetry shows fewer of the defects that accompany such poetry
everywhere, and more of the merits that render it a gentle and
idealized representation of nature and country life, than can perhaps
be found in any other literature of modern times. The reason is, that
there was more of a true pastoral character in Spain on which to build
it.<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>


<p class="mt2">Quite as characteristic of the Spanish national genius
as its pastorals were short poems in different forms, but in an
epigrammatic spirit, which appeared through the whole of the best age
of its literature. They are of two kinds. The first are generally
amorous, and always sentimental. Of these, not a few are very short and
pointed. They are found in the old Cancioneros and Romanceros, among
the works of Maldonado, Silvestre, Villegas, Góngora, and others of
less merit, to the end of the century. They are generally in the truest
tone of popular verse. One, which was set to music, was in these few
simple words:—</p>

<div class="poem mt1"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">To what ear shall I tell my griefs,</p>
<p class="i2">Gentle love mine?</p>
<p class="i0">To what ear shall I tell my griefs,</p>
<p class="i2">If not to thine?<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>
</div></div>

<p class="mt1">And another, of the same period, which was on a Sigh,
and became the subject of more than one gloss, was hardly less
simple:—</p>

<div class="poem mt1"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[p. 15]</span>O gentle sigh! O gentle sigh!</p>
<p class="i0">For no more happiness I pray,</p>
<p class="i0">Than, every time thou goest to God,</p>
<p class="i0">To follow where thou lead’st the way.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>
</div></div>

<p class="mt1">But of those a little longer and more elaborate a
favorable specimen may be found in Camoens, who wrote such with
tenderness and beauty, not only in his own language, but sometimes in
Spanish, as in the following lines on a concealed and unhappy passion,
the first two of which are probably a snatch of some old song, and the
rest his own gloss upon them:—</p>

<div class="poem mt1"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">Within, within, my sorrow lives,</p>
<p class="i0">But outwardly no token gives.</p>
<p class="i2">All young and gentle in the soul,</p>
<p class="i0">All hidden from men’s eyes,</p>
<p class="i0">Deep, deep within it lies,</p>
<p class="i2">And scorns the body’s low control.</p>
<p class="i0">As in the flint the hidden spark</p>
<p class="i0">Gives outwardly no sign or mark,</p>
<p class="i2">Within, within, my sorrow lives.<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>
</div></div>

<p class="mt1">The number of such compositions, in their different
serious forms, is great; but the number of the second kind—those in a
lighter and livelier tone—is still greater. The Argensolas, Villegas,
Lope de Vega, Quevedo, the Prince Esquilache, Rebolledo, and not a
few others, wrote them with spirit and effect. Of all, however, who
indulged in them, nobody devoted to their composition so much zeal,
and on the whole obtained so much success, as Francisco de la Torre,
who, though<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[p. 16]</span> of the
<i>culto</i> school, seemed able to shake off much of its influence, when he
remembered that he was a fellow-countryman of Martial.</p>

<p>He took for the foundation of his humor the remarkable Latin
epigrams of John Owen, the English Protestant, who died in 1622, and
whose witty volume has been often translated and printed at home
and abroad down to our own times;—a volume, it should be noted, so
offensive to the Romish Church as to have been early placed on its
Index Expurgatorius. But La Torre avoided whatever could give umbrage
to the ecclesiastical authorities of his time, and, adding a great
number of original epigrams quite as good as those he translated, made
a collection that fills two volumes, the last of which was printed in
1682, after its author’s death.<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22"
class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>But though he wrote more good epigrams, and in a greater variety of
forms, than any other individual Spaniard, he did not, perhaps, write
the best or the most national; for a few of those that still remain
anonymous, and a still smaller number by Rebolledo, seem to claim this
distinction. Of the sort of wit frequently affected in these slight
compositions the following is an example:—</p>

<div class="poem mt1"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">Fair lady, when your beads you take,</p>
<p class="i2">I never doubt you pray;</p>
<p class="i0">Perhaps for my poor murdered sake,</p>
<p class="i2">Perhaps for yours, that slay.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>
</div></div>

<p class="ti0 mt1"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[p.
17]</span>Rebolledo was sometimes happier than he is in this epigram,
though rarely more national.</p>


<p class="mt2">Didactic poetry in unsettled and uncertain forms
appeared early in Spain, and took, from time to time, the air both of
moral philosophy and of religious instruction. Specimens of it in the
old long-line stanza are found from the age of Berceo to that of the
chancellor Ayala; few, indeed, in number, but sufficiently marked in
character to show their purpose. Later, examples become more numerous,
and present themselves in forms somewhat improved. Several such occur
in the Cancioneros, among the best of which are Ludueña’s “Rules for
Good-Breeding”; “The Complaint of Fortune,” in imitation of Bias, by
Diego de San Pedro; and the “Coplas” of Don Juan Manuel of Portugal,
on the Seven Deadly Sins;—all of them authors known at the court of
Ferdinand and Isabella. Boscan’s poem on his own Conversion, that of
Silvestre on “Self-knowledge,” that of Castilla on “The Virtues,” and
that of Juan de Mendoza on “A Happy Life,” continue the series through
the reign of Charles the Fifth, but without materially advancing
its claims or its character.<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24"
class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p> <p><span class="pagenum"
id="Page_18">[p. 18]</span></p> <p>In the age of Philip the Second, the
didactic, like most of the other branches of Spanish poetry, spreads
out more broadly. Francisco de Guzman’s “Opinions<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_19">[p. 19]</span> of Wise Men,” and especially his dull
allegory of “Moral Triumphs,” in imitation of Petrarch, are, for
their length, the most important of the different didactic poems
which that period produced.<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25"
class="fnanchor">[25]</a> But more characteristic than either is the
deeply religious letter of Francisco de Aldana to Montano, in 1573;
and much more beautiful and touching than either is one written at
about the same time by Juan Rufo to his infant son, filled with gentle
affection and wise counsels.</p>

<p>Neither should a call made by Aldana, in the name of military
glory, to Philip himself, urging him to defend the suffering Church,
be overlooked. It breathes the very spirit of its subject, and may
well be put in direct contrast with the earnest and sad persuasions
to peace by Virues, who was yet a soldier by profession, and with
Cantorál’s winning invitation to the quietness of a country life. Some
of the religious poetry of Diego de Morillo and Pedro de Salas, in
the next reigns, with several of the wise epistles of the Argensolas,
Artieda, and Mesa, should be added; but they are all comparatively
short poems, except those by Morillo on the Words of Christ upon the
Cross, which extend to several hundred lines on each word, and which,
though disfigured by antithesis and exaggeration, are strongly marked
specimens of the Catholic didactic spirit.</p>

<p>In the mean time, and in the midst of this group,—partly because
the way had been already prepared for it by the publication, in
1591, of a good translation of Horace’s “Art of Poetry” by Espinel,
and partly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[p. 20]</span>
from other causes,<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26"
class="fnanchor">[26]</a>—we have, at last, a proper didactic poem,
or rather an attempt at one. It is by Juan de la Cueva, who in 1605
wrote in <i>terza rima</i> three epistles, which he entitled “Egemplar
Poético,” and which constitute the oldest formal and original effort
of the kind in the Spanish language. Regarded as a whole, they are,
indeed, far from being a complete Art of Poetry, and in some parts
they are injudicious and inconsequent; but they not unfrequently
contain passages of acute criticism in flowing verse, and they
have, besides, the merit of nationality in their tone. In all
respects, they are better than an absurd didactic poem, by the same
author, on “The Inventors of Things,” which he wrote three years
later, and which shows, as he showed elsewhere, that he adventured
in too many departments.<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27"
class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>Pablo de Céspedes, a sculptor and painter of the same period,—now
better known as a man of learning and a poet,—came nearer to success
than Cueva. He was born in 1538, at Córdova, and died there, a minor
canon of its magnificent cathedral, at the age of seventy; but he spent
a part of his life in Italy and at Seville, and devoted much of his
leisure to letters. Among other works, he began a poem, in <i>ottava
rima</i>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[p. 21]</span> on “The Art
of Painting.” Whether it was ever finished is uncertain; but all we
possess of it is a series of fragments, amounting, when taken together,
to six or seven hundred lines, which were inserted in a prose treatise
on the same subject by his friend Francisco Pacheco, and printed above
forty years after their author’s death. They are, however, such as
to make us regret that we have received no more. Their versification
is excellent, and their poetical energy and compactness are uniform.
Perhaps the best passage that has been preserved is the description of
a horse,—the animal of whose race the poet’s native city has always
been proud,—and of which, it is evident, a single noble individual
was pictured before his mind as he wrote. But other portions show
much talent,—perhaps more than this does; especially one in which he
explains the modes of acquiring practical skill in his art, and that
more poetical one in which he discusses color.<a id="FNanchor_28"
href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p>But the poems of Cueva and Céspedes were not printed till long
after the death of their authors; and none of their contemporaries
was inspired by like in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[p.
22]</span>fluences. The best that was done in didactic poetry, at about
the same time, was the slight, but pleasant, sort of defence of his
own irregularities produced by Lope de Vega, under the name of “The
New Art of Writing Plays”; and the best, written later in the century,
were the “Selvas,” as he called them, or poems in irregular verse, by
Count Rebolledo, on the Arts of War and Civil Government, which date
from 1652, but which are little more than rhymed prose. A long poem in
ten cantos, and in the old <i>quintilla</i> verse, by Trapeza, published in
1612, and entitled “The Cross,” because it is a sort of exposition of
all the theological virtues attributed to that holy emblem, is too dull
to be noticed, even if it were more strictly didactic in its form.<a
id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>Some other kindred attempts should, however, be remembered, of
which the oldest, made in the spirit of the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries throughout Europe, were in the form called “Emblems,”
or explanations in verse for hieroglyphical devices. The most
successful of these were probably the Emblems of Daza, in 1549,
imitated from the more famous Latin ones of Alciatus; and those of
Covarrubias, published originally in Spanish by their author in 1591,
and afterwards translated by him into Latin;—both of them curious
specimens of this peculiar style of composition, and as agreeable,
perhaps, as any which the age of Emblems produced.<a id="FNanchor_30"
href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p> <p><span
class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[p. 23]</span></p> <p>The other form was
that in which the didactic runs into the descriptive. Of this the most
poetical example in Spanish is by Dicastillo, a Carthusian monk, at
Saragossa, who published, in 1637, under the auspices of his friend
Mencos, a long poetical correspondence, intended to teach the vanity
of human things, and the happiness and merit to be found in a life of
penitential seclusion. The parts that relate to the author himself
are sometimes touching; but the rest is of very unequal worth,—the
better portions being devoted to a description of the grand and sombre
monastery of which he was an inmate, and of the observances to which
his life there was devoted.<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31"
class="fnanchor">[31]</a> Castilian verse, however, did not often
take a descriptive character, except when it appeared in the form
of eclogues and idyls; and even then it is almost always marked by
an ingenuity and brilliancy far from the healthy tone inspired by a
sincere love of what is grand or beautiful in nature;—a remark which
finds ample illustration in the poems devoted to the Spanish conquests
in America, where the marvellous tropical vegetation of the valleys
through which the wild adventurers wound their way, and the snow-capped
volcanoes that crowned the <i>sierras</i> above their heads, seem to have
failed alike to stir their imaginations or overawe their courage.<a
id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[p. 24]</span>But except these
irregular varieties of didactic poetry, we have, for the whole of the
sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, nothing to add to what we have
already noticed, beyond a repetition of the old forms of epistles
and <i>silvas</i>, which so frequently occur in the works of Castillejo,
Ledesma, Lope de Vega, Jauregui, Zarate, and their contemporaries.
Nor could we reasonably expect more. Neither the popular character of
Spanish poetry, nor the severe nature of the Spanish ecclesiastical and
political constitutions of government, was favorable to the development
of this particular form of verse, or likely to tolerate it on any
important subject. Didactic poetry remained, therefore, at the end of
the period, as it was at the beginning, one of the feeblest and least
successful departments of the national literature.<a id="FNanchor_33"

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> collection and publication of the
popular ballads of the country in the Cancioneros and Romanceros,
in the sixteenth century, attracted to them a kind and degree of
attention they had failed to receive during the long period in which
they had been floating about among the unrecorded traditions of the
common people. There was so much that was beautiful in them, so
much that appealed successfully to the best recollections of all
classes, so much directly connected with the great periods of the
national glory, that the minds of all were stirred by them, as soon
as they appeared in a permanent form, and they became, at once,
favorites of the more cultivated portion of the people, as they had
always been of the humble hearts that gave them birth. The natural
consequence followed;—they were imitated;—and not merely by poets who
occasionally wrote in this among other forms of verse, but by persons
who composed them in large numbers and published them by volumes.<a
id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[p. 26]</span></p> <p>The first
of these persons was Lorenzo de Sepúlveda, whose Ballad-book can be
traced back to 1551, the very year after the appearance, at Saragossa,
of the earliest collection of popular and anonymous ballads, gathered
from the memories of the people. The attempt of Sepúlveda was made
in the right direction; for he founded it almost entirely on the old
Castilian Chronicles, and appealed, as they did, to popular tradition
and the national feelings for his support. In his Preface, he says,
that his ballads “ought to be more savory than many others, because
not only are they true and drawn from the truest histories he could
find, but written in the Castilian measure and in the tone of the old
ballads, which,” he adds, “<i>is now in fashion</i>. They were taken,” he
declares, “literally from the Chronicle which was compiled by the most
serene king Don Alfonso; the same who, for his good letters and royal
desires, and great learning in all branches of knowledge, was called
‘The Wise.’” In fact, more than three fourths of this curious volume
consist of ballads taken from the “General Chronicle of Spain,” often
employing its very words, and always imbued with its spirit. The rest
is made up chiefly of ballads founded on sacred and ancient history, or
on mythological and other stories of an imaginary nature.</p>

<p>But, unfortunately, Sepúlveda was not truly a poet, and therefore,
though he sought his subjects in good sources and seldom failed to
select them well, he yet failed to give any more of a poetical coloring
to his ballads than he found in the old chronicles he followed. He was,
however, successful as far as the general favor<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_27">[p. 27]</span> was concerned; for not only was his
entire work reprinted at least four times, but the separate ballads
in it constantly reappear in the old collections<a id="FNanchor_35"
href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> that were, from time to
time, published to meet the popular demand.</p>

<p>Quite as characteristic of the period is a small selection of
ballads printed for the first time in 1564. It was made by some person
of distinction, who sent it to Alonso de Fuentes, with a request that
he would furnish it with all needful explanations in prose. This he
did; but the original collector died before it was published. Of the
forty ballads of which it consists, ten are on subjects from the Bible;
ten from Roman history; ten from other portions of ancient history; and
the remainder from the history of Spain, coming down to the fall of
Granada. We are not told where they were obtained, and none of them has
much value;—the great merit of the whole, in the eyes of those who were
concerned in their publication, consisting, no doubt, in the wearisome
historical and moral commentary by which each is followed.</p>

<p>Fuentes, however, who intimates that the task was hardly worthy
of his position, may have had a better taste in such things than the
person who employed him; for, in a prefatory epistle, he gives us,
of his own accord, the following ballad, evidently very old, if not
very spirited, which he attributes to Alfonso the Wise. But it is no
otherwise the work of that monarch than that all but the last stanzas
are taken from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[p. 28]</span>
remarkable letter he wrote on the disastrous position of his affairs in
1280, when, by the rebellion of his son and the desertion of the higher
ecclesiastics of his kingdom, he was reduced, in his old age, to misery
and despair,—a letter already cited, and more poetical than the ballad
founded on it.</p>

<p class="mt1">Juan de Timoneda, partly bookseller and partly poet,—the
friend of Lope de Rueda, and, like him, the author
of farces acted in the public squares of Valencia,—was,
both from his occupations and tastes, a person
who would naturally understand the general poetical
feeling and wants of his time. In consequence of this,
probably, he published, in 1573, a collection of ballads,
entitled “The Rose,” consisting, in no small degree, of
his own compositions, but containing, also, some by
other and older poets. Taken together, they constitute
a volume of nearly seven hundred pages, divided into
“The Rose of Love”; “The Spanish Rose”; “The
Gentile Rose,” so called, because its subjects are heathen;
and “The Royal Rose,” which is on the fates
and fortunes of princes;—the whole being followed by
about a hundred pages of popular, miscellaneous verse,
rustic songs, and fanciful glosses.</p>

<p>The best parts of this large collection are the ballads gathered by
its author from popular tradition, most of which were soon published
in other Roman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[p. 30]</span>ceros,
with the variations their origin necessarily involved. The poorest
parts are those written by himself,—such as the last division, which
is entirely his own, and is not superior to the similar ballads in
Sepúlveda and Fuentes. As a collection, however, it is important;
because it shows how true the Spanish people remained to their old
traditions, and how constantly they claimed to have the best portions
of their history repeated to them in the old forms to which they had
so long been accustomed. In another point of view, also, it is of
consequence. It furnishes ballads on the early heroes of Spain, some
of which are needed to fill up two or three of the best among their
traditional stories, while others come down, with similar accounts
of later heroes, to the end of the Moorish wars.<a id="FNanchor_37"
href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p>In 1583, the series of such popular works was still further
continued by Pedro de Padilla, who published a Romancero containing
sixty-three long ballads of his own,—about half of them taken from
uncertain traditions, or from fables like those of Ariosto, and the
others from the known history of Spain, which they follow down through
the times of Charles the Fifth and the Flemish wars of Philip the
Second. The Italian measures several times intrude, where they can
produce only an awkward and incongruous effect; and the rest of the
volume, not devoted to ballads,—except fifty <i>villancicos</i>, which
are full of the old popular spirit,—is composed of poems in the
Italian manner, that add nothing to its value.<a id="FNanchor_38"
href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p> <p><span
class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[p. 31]</span></p> <p>Juan de la Cueva,
finding the old national subjects thus seized upon by his predecessors,
resorted, it would seem, from necessity, to the histories of Greece and
Rome for his materials, and in 1587 published a volume containing above
a hundred ballads, which he divided into ten books, placing nine of
them under the protection of the nine Muses, and the other under that
of Apollo. Their poetical merit is inconsiderable. The best are a few
whose subjects are drawn from the old Castilian Chronicle, like that
on the sad story of Doña Teresa, who, after being wedded against her
will to the Moorish king of Toledo, was miraculously permitted to take
refuge in a convent, rather than consummate her hated marriage with an
infidel. Two ballads, however, in which the author gives an account of
himself and of his literary undertakings, are more curious;—the latter
containing an amusing account of some of the bad poets of his time.<a
id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p>The publication of the first part of “The Civil Wars of Granada,”
by Hita, in 1595, containing about sixty ballads, some of them very
old, and several of great poetical merit, increased, no doubt, the
impulse which the frequent appearance of volumes of popular anonymous
ballads continued to give to Spanish poetry in this attractive form.<a
id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> This
is yet more apparent in the new direction taken by ballad-writing,
which from this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[p. 32]</span> time
began to select particular subjects and address itself to separate
classes of readers. Thus, in 1609, we have a volume of ballads in the
dialect of the rogues, written in the very spirit of the vagabonds
it represents, and collected by some one who concealed himself under
the name of Juan Hidalgo;<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41"
class="fnanchor">[41]</a>—while in 1612, at the other extreme of the
cycle, Valdivielso, the fashionable ecclesiastic, printed a large
“Spiritual Ballad-book,” whose ballads are all on religious subjects,
and all intended to promote habits of devotion.<a id="FNanchor_42"
href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> In 1614 and 1622, Lope
de Vega, always a lover of such poetry, gave to the religious world a
collection of similar devout ballads, often reprinted afterwards;<a
id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> and in
1629 and 1634, he contributed materials to two other collections of
the same character,—the first anonymous, and entitled “A Bouquet of
Divine Flowers”; and the other by Luis de Arellano, which, under the
name of “Counsels for the Dying,” contains thirty ballads, several
of which are by the principal poets of the time.<a id="FNanchor_44"
href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[p. 33]</span>Others,
like Roca y Serna, wrote large numbers of ballads, but did not
print them separately.<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45"
class="fnanchor">[45]</a> Those of the Prince Esquilache, some of which
are excellent, amount to nearly three hundred. Antonio de Mendoza wrote
about two hundred; and perhaps as many, in every possible variety of
character, are scattered through the works of Quevedo; so that, by the
middle of the seventeenth century, there can be no doubt that large and
successful efforts had been made by the known authors of the period to
continue the old ballad spirit by free contributions, both in separate
volumes and in masses of ballads inserted among their other published
works.</p>

<p>Meantime the old spirit itself had not been lost. The ballad-book
known originally under the name of “Flor de Romances,” which we have
already traced in its individual parts to five small volumes,—published
between 1593 and 1597, in such widely different portions of Spain,
that its materials were gathered from the soil of nearly the whole
country,—continued to be valued, and was reprinted and enlarged,
under the name of “El Romancero General,” four times; till, with the
Ballad-book of 1550-1555, it comprehended nearly all the old ballads
that had been preserved by tradition, together with not a few by
Lope de Vega, Góngora, and other living authors. Out of these two
vast storehouses, and from such other sources as could still yield
suitable materials, smaller and more popular ballad-books were now
selected and published. One appeared at Barcelona in 1582, and was
reprinted there in 1602 and 1696, taken in a considerable degree from
the collection of 1550, but containing, besides, ballads not<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[p. 34]</span> found elsewhere, and among
the rest, several on the history of the triple league and on the
death of Philip the Second.<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46"
class="fnanchor">[46]</a> A ballad-book for “The Twelve Peers,”
and their marvellous achievements, published for the first time in
1608, has continued to be a favorite ever since;<a id="FNanchor_47"
href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> and four years afterwards
appeared “The Ballad-Book of the Cid,” which has been printed and
reprinted again and again, at home and abroad, down to our own times.<a
id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> These
were followed, in 1623, by the “Primavera,” or Spring of Ballads, by
Perez, of which a second part was collected and published by Segura
in 1629, comprehending together nearly three hundred;—most, but
not all, of them known before, and many of them of great beauty.<a
id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> And
other ballad-books of the same sort, as well as these, continued to be
printed in cheap forms for popular use till the old Castilian culture
disappeared with the decay of the old national character.</p>

<p>But during the long period of a century and a half when this kind
of poetry prevailed so widely in Spain, the ballads were not left to
the formal Romanceros, whether anonymous, like the largest, or by
known authors, like those of Sepúlveda and Cueva, nor even to persons
who wrote them in great numbers and printed<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_35">[p. 35]</span> them in a separate department of their
collected works, as did Prince Esquilache. On the contrary, between
1550 and 1700, hardly a Spanish poet can be found through whose works
they are not scattered with such profusion, that the number of popular
ballads that could be collected from them would, if brought together,
greatly exceed in amount all that are found in the ballad-books
proper. Many of the ballads which thus occur either separately or in
small groups are picturesque and beautiful in the same way the elder
ones are, though rarely to the same degree. Silvestre, Montemayor,
Espinel, Castillejo, and, above all of his time, Lopez de Maldonado,
wrote them with success, towards the end of the sixteenth century.<a
id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> A
little later, those of Góngora are admirable. Indeed, his more simple,
childlike ballads, and those in which a gay, mischievous spirit is
made to conceal a genuine tenderness, are unlike almost any of their
class found elsewhere, and can hardly be surpassed.<a id="FNanchor_51"
href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> But Góngora afterwards
introduced the same affected and false style into this form of his
poetry that he did into the rest, and was followed, with constantly
increasing absurdities, by Arteaga, Pantaleon, Villamediana, Coronel,
and the rest of his imitators, whose ballads are generally worse than
any thing else they wrote, because, from the very simplicity and truth
required by the proper nature of such compositions, they less tolerate
an appearance of affectation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[p. 36]</span>Cervantes, who
was Góngora’s contemporary, tells us that he composed vast numbers
which are now lost; and, from his own opinion of them, we have no
reason to regret their fate. Lope’s, on the contrary, which he
preserved with a care for his own reputation that was not at all
characteristic of Cervantes, are still numerous and often excellent;
especially those that relate to himself and his loves, some of the
best of which seem to have been produced at Valencia and Lisbon.<a
id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> At
the same time and later, good ballads were written by Quevedo, who
descended even to the style of the rogues in their composition; by
Bernarda de Fereira, a nun in the romantic convent of Buzaco, in
Portugal; by Rebolledo, the diplomatist; and perhaps, though with some
hesitation, we should add, by Solís, the historian.<a id="FNanchor_53"
href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> Indeed, wherever we
turn, in the Spanish poetry of this period, we find ballads in all
their varieties of tone and character,—often by authors otherwise
little known, like Alarcon, who, in the end of the sixteenth century,
wrote excellent devout ballads,<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54"
class="fnanchor">[54]</a> or Diego de la Chica, who is remembered
only for a single satirical one, preserved by Espinosa in the
beginning of the seventeenth;<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55"
class="fnanchor">[55]</a>—but we always find them in the works of
those poets of note who desired to stand well with the mass of their
countrymen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[p. 37]</span>Nor could it be
otherwise;—for ballads, in the seventeenth century, had become the
delight of the whole Spanish people. The soldier solaced himself with
them in his tent, and the muleteer amidst the <i>sierras</i>; the maiden
danced to them on the green, and the lover sang them for his serenade;
they entered into the low orgies of thieves and vagabonds, into the
sumptuous entertainments of the luxurious nobility, and into the
holiday services of the Church; the blind beggar chanted them to gather
alms, and the puppet-showman gave them in recitative to explain his
exhibition; they were a part of the very foundation of the theatre,
both secular and religious, and the theatre carried them everywhere,
and added everywhere to their effect and authority. No poetry of
modern times has been so widely spread through all classes of society,
and none has so entered into the national character. The ballads, in
fact, seem to have been found on every spot of Spanish soil. They seem
to have filled the very air that men breathed.<a id="FNanchor_56"

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> romances of chivalry, like the
institutions on which they were founded, lingered long in Spain. Their
grave fictions were suited to the air of the stern old castles with
which the Moorish contest had studded large portions of the country,
while their general tone harmonized no less happily with the stately
manners which the spirit of knighthood had helped to impress on the
higher classes of society, from the mountains of Biscay to the shores
of the Mediterranean. Their influence, therefore, was great; and, as
one natural result of its long continuance, other and better forms
of prose fiction were discountenanced in Spain, or appeared later
than they might have done under different circumstances;—a fact to
which Cervantes alludes, when, even at the opening of the seventeenth
century, he complains that Spanish books of the latter character were
still rarely to be found.<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57"
class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<p>Fifty years, however, before that period, signs of a coming change
are perceptible. The magnificent successes of Charles the Fifth had
already filled the minds<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[p.
39]</span> of men with a spirit of adventure very different from that
of Amadis and his descendants, though sometimes hardly less wild and
extravagant. The cruel wars unceasingly kept up with the Barbary
powers, and the miseries of the thousands of captives who returned from
Africa, to amaze their countrymen with tragical stories of their own
trials and those of their fellow-sufferers, were full of that bitter
romance of real life which outruns all fiction. Manners, too,—the old,
formal, knightly manners of the nobility,—were beginning to be modified
by intercourse with the rest of the world, and especially with Italy,
then the most refined and least military country of Christendom; so
that romantic fiction—the department of elegant literature, which,
above every other, depends on the state of society—was naturally
modified in Spain by the great changes going on in the external
relations and general culture of the kingdom. Of this state of things,
and of its workings in the new forms of fiction produced by it, we
shall find frequent proofs as we advance.</p>


<p class="mt2">The first form, however, in which a change in the
national taste manifested itself with well-defined success—that of
<i>prose pastorals</i>—is perhaps not one which would have been anticipated
even by the more sagacious; though, when we now look back upon its
history, we can easily discover some of the foundations on which it was
originally built.</p>

<p>From the Middle Ages the occupations of a shepherd’s life
had prevailed in Spain and Portugal to a greater extent than
elsewhere in Europe;<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58"
class="fnanchor">[58]</a> and, probably in con<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_40">[p. 40]</span>sequence of this circumstance, eclogues
and bucolics were early known in the poetry of both countries, and
became connected in both with the origin of the popular drama. On the
other hand, the military spirit of such a civilization as existed in
Spain down to the sixteenth century may have gladly turned away from
such a monotonous exaggeration of its own character as is found in
the romances of chivalry, and sought refreshment and repose in the
peace and simplicity of a fabulous Arcadia. At least, these are the
two obvious circumstances in the condition and culture of Spain, that
favored the appearance of so singular a form of fiction as that of
prose pastorals, though how much influence either exercised it may now
be impossible to determine.</p>

<p>On one point, however, we are not left in doubt. We know whence
the impulse came that called forth such a work for the first time in
Castilian literature, and when it appeared there. It was Sannazaro,—a
Neapolitan gentleman, whose family had been carried from Spain to
Naples by the political revolutions of the preceding century,—who
is the true father of the modern prose pastoral, which, from him,
passed directly to Spain, and, during a long period of success in
that country, never entirely lost the character its author had
originally impressed upon it. His “Arcadia”—written, probably, without
any reference to the Greek pastoral of Longus, but hardly without a
knowledge of the “Ameto” of Boccaccio and the Eclogues of Bembo—was
first published entire, at Naples, in 1504.<a id="FNanchor_59"
href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> It is a genuine pastoral
romance in prose and verse, in which, with a slight connecting
narrative, and under the disguise of the loves of shepherds and
shepherdesses, Sannazaro<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[p.
41]</span> relates adventures that really occurred to him and to some
of his friends;—he himself appearing under the name of Sincero, who is
its principal personage. Such a work, of course, is somewhat fantastic
from its very nature; but the fiction of Sannazaro was written in the
purest and most graceful Italian, and had a great success;—a success
which, perhaps, from the Spanish connections of his family, was early
extended to Spain. At any rate, Spain was the first foreign country
where the Arcadia was imitated, and was afterwards the only one where
such works appeared in large numbers, and established a lasting
influence.</p>

<p>It is singular, however, that, like the romances of chivalry,
pastoral romance was first introduced into Spain by a Portuguese,—by
George of Montemayor, a native of the town of that name, near Coimbra.
When he was born we are not told; probably it was before 1520. In
his youth he was a soldier; but later, from his skill in music, he
became attached to the travelling chapel of the prince of Spain,
afterwards Philip the Second, and thus enjoyed an opportunity of
visiting foreign countries, especially Italy and Flanders. But his mind
was little cultivated by study. He knew no Latin, which even those
of the humblest literary attainments were wont to acquire, in the
age when he lived; so that his success is due to his own genius and
to the promptings of that passion which gave its color to his life.
Probably he left Spain from disappointment in love; probably, too, he
perished in a duel at Turin, in 1561. But we know nothing more of him
with any tolerable certainty.<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60"
class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<p>His “Diana Enamorada,” the chief of his works,<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_42">[p. 42]</span> was first printed at Valencia, in 1542.<a
id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>
It is written in good Castilian, like his poetry, which is
published separately, though, like that, with some intermixture
of his native Portuguese;<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62"
class="fnanchor">[62]</a> and it contains, as he tells us,
stories of adventures which really occurred.<a id="FNanchor_63"
href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> We know, too, that,
under the name of Sereno, he was himself its hero; and Lope de Vega
adds, that Diana, its heroine, was a lady of Valencia de Don Juan, a
town near the city of Leon.<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64"
class="fnanchor">[64]</a> Montemayor’s purpose, therefore, like that
of Sannazaro, is to give, in the forms of a pastoral romance, an
account of some events in his own life and in the lives of a few of
his friends. To effect this, he brings together on the banks of the
Ezla, at the foot of the mountains of Leon, a number of shepherds and
shepherdesses, who relate their respective stories through seven books
of prose, intermingled with verse. But the two principal personages,
Sereno and Diana,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[p. 43]</span>
who are introduced at first as lovers, are separated by magic; and
the romance is brought to an abrupt conclusion, little conformable to
all the previous intimations, by the marriage of Diana to Delio, the
unworthy rival of Sereno.</p>

<p>On first reading the Diana of Montemayor, it is not easy to
understand it. The separate stories of which it is composed are so
involved with each other, and so inartificially united, that we are
constantly losing the thread of the principal narration;—a difficulty
which is much increased by the mixture of true and false geography,
heathenism, magic, Christianity, and all the various contradictory
impossibilities that naturally follow an attempt to place in the heart
of Spain, and near one of its best-known cities, a poetical Arcadia,
that never existed anywhere. The Diana, however, better merits the
name of a romance than the Arcadia, which served for its model. Its
principal fiction is ampler and more ingeniously constructed. Its
episodes are more interesting. Much of it is warm with the tenderness
of a disappointed attachment, which, no doubt, caused the whole to be
written. Some of the poetry is beautiful, especially the lyric poetry;
and if its prose style is not so pure as that of Sannazaro, it is still
to be remarked for its grace and richness. Notwithstanding its many
defects, therefore, the Diana is not without an interest for us even
at this remote period, when the whole class of fictions to which it
belongs is discountenanced and almost forgotten; and we feel that only
poetical justice was done to it when it was saved, by the good taste of
the curate, in the destruction of Don Quixote’s library.</p>

<p>The Diana, as has been intimated, was left unfinished by its author;
but in 1564, three years after his death, Alonso Perez, a physician
of Salamanca, to whom Mon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[p.
44]</span>temayor, before he finally left Spain, had communicated his
plan for completing it, published a second part, which opens in the
enchanted palace of Felicia, where the first ends, and gives us the
adventures and stories of several shepherds and shepherdesses, not
introduced before, as well as a continuation of the original fiction.
But this second part, like the first, fails to complete the romance.
It advances no farther than to the death of Delio, the husband of
Diana,—which, according to the purpose of Montemayor, was to have been
followed by her union with Sereno, her first and true lover,—and then
stops abruptly, with the promise of yet a third part, which never
appeared. Nor was it, probably, demanded with any earnestness; for the
second, protracted through seven books, and considerably longer than
its predecessor, is much inferior to it in merit. It lacks, in all its
many stories, the tenderness which the disappointment of Montemayor
had given to the first portion of the work; and, what perhaps is of no
less consequence in this kind of composition, the prose is heavy and
monotonous, and the verse worse.<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65"
class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

<p>But this unfortunate attempt was not the only consequence of
Montemayor’s success. The same year with that in which the work of
Perez was published, another continuation appeared at Valencia, by
Gaspar Gil Polo, a gentleman of that city, who was a Professor of
Greek in its University.<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66"
class="fnanchor">[66]</a> The Diana of Polo has the<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[p. 45]</span> merit of being shorter than
either of its predecessors. It is divided into five books, and contains
an account of the falsehood and death of Delio, and the marriage of
Diana to Sereno, whom she finds when she is seeking the husband who
had basely abandoned her for another shepherdess. Several episodes
and much pastoral poetry of different kinds are skilfully inserted;
but though the original plan of Montemayor seems to be completed, the
book ends with the promise of a still further continuation, which,
though the author lived nearly thirty years after he made it, seems
never to have been written.<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67"
class="fnanchor">[67]</a> His work, however, was successful. Its
prose has always found favor, and so have some portions of its verse;
especially the <i>cancion</i> of Nerea in the third book, and several of
the shorter poems in the last.<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68"
class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>

<p>The “Ten Books of Fortune and Love,” by Antonio de Lo Frasso,
a Sardinian and a soldier, published in 1573, is the next Spanish
romance of the same class with the Diana; but it is without merit,
and was forgotten soon after it appeared.<a id="FNanchor_69"
href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> Nine years later,
in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[p. 46]</span> 1582, a better one
was published,—the “Fílida,”—which passed early through five editions,
and is still valued and read.<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70"
class="fnanchor">[70]</a> Its author, Luis Galvez de Montalvo, was born
in Guadalaxara, a town near Alcalá, the birthplace of Cervantes; and,
perhaps from this circumstance, they soon became acquainted, for they
were long friends, and often praised each other in their respective
works.<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>
They seem, however, to have had very different characters; for,
instead of the life of adventure led by Cervantes, Montalvo attached
himself to the great family of Infantado, descended from the Marquis
of Santillana, and passed most of his life as a sort of idle
courtier and retainer in their ducal halls, near the place of his
nativity. Subsequently he went to Italy, where he translated and
published, in 1587, “The Tears of Saint Peter,” by Tansillo, and had
begun a translation of the “Jerusalem Delivered” of Tasso, when he
was cut off in the midst of his labors by an accidental death, in
Sicily, about the year 1591.<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72"
class="fnanchor">[72]</a></p>

<p>His “Fílida,” in seven parts, was written while he was attached to
the Duke of Infantado; for he announces himself on the title-page as “a
gentleman and a courtier,” and, in his Dedication to one of the family,
says that “his greatest labor is to live idle, contented, and honored
as one of the servants of their house.” The romance contains, as was
usual in such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[p. 47]</span> works,
the adventures of living and known personages, among whom were Montalvo
himself, Cervantes, and the nobleman to whom it is dedicated. But the
tone of pastoral life is not better preserved than it is in the other
fictions of the same class. Indeed, in the sixth part, there is a most
inappropriate critical discussion on the merits of the two schools of
Spanish poetry then contending for fashionable mastery; and in the
seventh is a courtly festival, with running at the ring, in which the
shepherds appear on horseback with lances and armorial bearings, like
knights. The prose style of the whole is pure and good; and among the
poems with which it abounds, a few in the old Spanish measure may be
selected that are nearly, if not quite, equal to the similar poems of
Montemayor.</p>

<p>Cervantes, too, as we have already noticed, was led by the spirit
of the times, rather, perhaps, than by his own taste, to begin—as
an offering to the lady of his love—the “Galatea,” of which the
first six books, published in 1584, were all that ever appeared.<a
id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> This
was followed, in 1586, by “Truth for the Jealous”; again a romance in
six books, and, like the last, unfinished. It was written by Bartolomé
Lopez de Enciso, of whom we know from himself that he was a young man
when he wrote it, and that it was his purpose to publish a second part,
of which, however, nothing more was heard. Nor can we regret that he
failed to fulfil his promise. His fictions, which are occupied chiefly
with the nymphs and shepherds of the Tagus, are among the most confused
and unmeaning that have ever been attempted. His scene is laid, from
its opening, in the days of the most ancient Greek mythology; but the
Genius of Spain, in the fifth book, carries the<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_48">[p. 48]</span> same shepherds who thus figure in the first
to a magnificent temple, and shows them the statues of Charles the
Fifth, of Philip the Second, and even of Philip the Third, who was not
yet on the throne;—thus confounding the earliest times of classical
antiquity with an age which, at the end of the sixteenth century, was
yet to come. Other inconsequences follow, in great numbers, as matters
of course, while nothing in either the prose or the poetry is of value
enough to compensate for the absurdities in the story. Indeed, few
portions of Spanish literature show any thing more stiff and wearisome
than the long declamations and discussions in this dull fiction.<a
id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<p>Another pastoral romance in six books, entitled “The Nymphs of the
Henares,” by Bernardo Gonzalez de Bovadilla, was printed in 1587. The
author, who was a native of the Canary Islands, confesses that he has
placed the scene of his story on the banks of the Henares without
having ever seen them; but both he and his romance have long since been
forgotten. So has “The Shepherds of Iberia,” in four books, by Bernardo
de la Vega, supposed to have been a native of Madrid, and certainly a
canon of Tucuman, in Peru, whose ill-written story appeared in 1591.
But that these, and all that preceded them, enjoyed for a time the
public favor is made plain by the fact, that they are all found in the
library of Don Quixote, and that three of them receive high praise
from Cervantes;—much higher than has been confirmed by the decision
of subsequent generations.<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75"
class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p> <p><span class="pagenum"
id="Page_49">[p. 49]</span></p> <p>Some time, however, elapsed before
another came to continue the series, except the “Arcadia” of Lope de
Vega, which, though written long before, was not printed till 1598.<a
id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> At last,
“The Age of Gold,” by Bernardo de Balbuena, appeared. Its author,
born on the vine-clad declivities of the Val de Peñas, in 1568, early
accompanied his family to Mexico, where he was educated, and where,
when only seventeen years old, he was already known as a poet. Once, at
least, he visited his native country, and perhaps oftener; but he seems
to have spent most of his life, either in Jamaica, where he enjoyed an
ecclesiastical benefice, or in Puerto Rico, of which he was afterwards
bishop, and where he died in 1627.</p>

<p>Of the manners of the New World, however, or of its magnificent
scenery, his “Age of Gold in the Woods of Eriphile” shows no trace.
It was printed at Madrid, in 1608, and might have been written, if
its author had never been in any other city. But it is not without
merit. The poetry with which it abounds is generally of the Italian
school, but is much better than can be found in most of these doubtful
romances; and its prose, though sometimes affected, is oftener sweet
and flowing. Probably nothing in the nine eclogues—as its divisions are
unsuitably called—is connected with either the history or the scandal
of the times; and if this be the case, we have, perhaps, an explanation
of the fact that it was less regarded by those contemporary with its
publication than were similar works of inferior merit. But whatever
may have been the cause, it was long overlooked; no second edition of
it being de<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[p. 50]</span>manded
till 1821, when it received the rare honor of being published anew
by the Spanish Academy.<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77"
class="fnanchor">[77]</a></p>

<p>The very next year after the first appearance of “The Age of Gold,”
Christóval Suarez de Figueroa, a native of Valladolid, a jurist and
a soldier, published his “Constant Amaryllis, in Four Discourses,”
crowded, like all its predecessors, with short poems, and, like most
of them, claiming to tell a tale not a little of which was true.<a
id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> Its
author, who lived a great deal in Italy, was already known by an
excellent translation of Guarini’s “Pastor Fido,”<a id="FNanchor_79"
href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> and published,
at different times afterwards, several original works which
enjoyed much reputation.<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80"
class="fnanchor">[80]</a></p>

<p>But he seems to have been a man of an unkind and unfaithful
character. In a curious account of his own life which appeared in his
“Traveller,” he speaks harsh<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[p.
51]</span>ly and insidiously of many of his contemporaries; and towards
Cervantes—who had just died, after praising every body most generously
during his whole life—he is absolutely malignant.<a id="FNanchor_81"
href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> His last work is dated
in 1621, and this is the last fact we know in relation to him. His
“Amaryllis,” which, as he intimates, was composed to please a person
of great consideration, did not satisfy its author.<a id="FNanchor_82"
href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> It is, however, written
in an easy and tolerably pure style; and though it contains formal
and wearisome discussions, like that in the first part on Poetry, and
awkward machinery, such as a vision of Venus and her court in the
second, it is the only one of his works that has been reprinted or much
read within the last century.</p>

<p>A few pastoral romances appeared in Spain after the Amaryllis, but
none of so much merit, and none that enjoyed any considerable degree
of favor. Espinel Adorno;<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83"
class="fnanchor">[83]</a> Botelho, a Portuguese;<a id="FNanchor_84"
href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> Quintana, who
assumed the name of Cuevas;<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85"
class="fnanchor">[85]</a> Corral;<a id="FNanchor_86"
href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> and Saave<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[p. 52]</span>dra,<a id="FNanchor_87"
href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> close up the series;—the
last bringing us down to just about a century from the first appearance
of such fictions in the time of Montemayor, and all of them infected
with the false taste of the period. Taken together, they leave no
doubt that pastoral romance was the first substitute in Spain for the
romances of chivalry, and that it inherited no small degree of their
popularity. Most of the works we have noticed were several times
reprinted, and the “Diana” of Montemayor, the first and best of them
all, was probably more read in Spain during the sixteenth century than
any Spanish work of amusement except the “Celestina.”</p>

<p>All this seems remarkable and strange, when we consider only the
absurdities and inconsequences with which such fictions necessarily
abound. But there is another side to the question, which should not
be overlooked. Pastoral romance, after all, has its foundation in
one of the truest and deepest principles of our common nature,—that
love of rural beauty, of rural peace, in short, of whatever goes to
constitute a country life, as distinguished from the constrained
life of a city, which few are too dull to feel, and fewer still so
artificial as wholly to reject. It has, therefore, prevailed more or
less in all modern countries, as we may see in Italy, from the success
that followed Sannazaro; in France, from the “Astrea” of Durfé; and in
England, from the “Arcadia” of Sir Philip Sidney;—the two latter being
pastoral romances of enormous length, compared<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_53">[p. 53]</span> with any in Spanish; and the very last
enjoying for above a century a popularity which may well be compared
with that of the “Diana” of Montemayor, if, indeed, it did not equal
it.<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></p>

<p>No doubt, in Spain, as elsewhere, the incongruities of such
fictions were soon perceived. Even some of those who most indulged
in them showed that it was not entirely from a misapprehension of
their nature. Cervantes, who died regretting that he should leave
his “Galatea” unfinished, still makes himself merry more than once
in his “Don Quixote” with all such fancies; and, in his “Colloquy of
the Dogs,” permits one of them, who had been in shepherd service,
to satirize the false exhibition of life in the best pastorals of
his time, not forgetting his own among the rest.<a id="FNanchor_89"
href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> Lope de Vega, too, though
he published his “Arcadia” under circumstances which show that he set
a permanent value upon its gentle tales, could still, in a play where
shepherds are introduced, make one of them—who found a real life among
flocks and herds in rough weather much less agreeable than the life he
had read of in the pastorals—say, when suffering in a storm,—</p>

<div class="poem mt1"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">And I should like just now to see those men</p>
<p class="i0">Who write such books about a shepherd’s life,</p>
<p class="i0">Where all is spring and flowers and trees and brooks.<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></p>
</div></div>

<p class="mt1"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[p. 54]</span>Still,
neither Cervantes, nor Lope, nor any body else in their time, thought
seriously of discountenancing pastoral fictions. On the contrary,
there was in their very style—which was generally an imitation of
the Italian, that gave birth to them all—something attractive to a
cultivated Castilian ear, at a time when the school of Garcilasso was
at the height of its popularity and favor. Besides this, the real
events they recorded, and the love-stories of persons in high life that
they were known to conceal, made them sometimes riddles and sometimes
masquerades, which engaged the curiosity of those who moved in the
circles either of their authors or of their heroes and heroines.<a
id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> But more
than all, the glimpses they afforded of nature and truth—such genuine
and deep tenderness as is shown by Montemayor, and such graceful
descriptions of natural scenery as abound in Balbuena—were, no doubt,
refreshing in a state of society stiff and formal as was that at the
Spanish court in the times of Philip the Second and Philip the Third,
and in the midst of a culture more founded on military virtues and
the spirit of knighthood than any other of modern times. As long,
therefore, as this state of things continued, pastoral fictions and
fancies, filled with the dreams of a poetical Arcadia, enjoyed a degree
of favor in Spain which they never enjoyed anywhere else. But when this
disappeared, they disappeared with it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> next form of prose fiction produced
in Spain, and the one which, from its greater truth, has enjoyed a
more permanent regard than the last, is found in those stories that
have commonly gone under the name of “tales in the <i>gusto picaresco</i>,”
or tales in the style of rogues. Taken as a class, they constitute
a singular exhibition of character, and are, in fact, as separate
and national in their air as any thing in the whole body of modern
literature.</p>

<p>Their origin is obvious, and the more so from what is most singular
in their character. They sprang directly from the condition of some
portions of society in Spain when they appeared;—a condition, it should
be added, which has existed there ever since, and contributed to
preserve for the stories that bear its impress no little of the favor
they have always enjoyed. Before speaking of them in detail, we must,
therefore, notice the peculiar circumstances of the country, and the
peculiar state of manners that gave them birth.</p>

<p>The wars of the opposing races and religions, that had constituted
so much of the business of life, and so long engrossed the thoughts
of men, in Spain, had, indeed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[p.
56]</span> nearly ceased from the time of Ferdinand and Isabella. But
the state of character they had produced in the Spanish people had by
no means ceased with them. On the contrary, it had been kept in the
freshest activity by those vast enterprises which Charles the Fifth
had pushed forward in Italy, France, and Germany, with such success,
that the Spanish nation, always marked by a sanguine enthusiasm, had
become fully persuaded that it was destined to achieve an empire which,
covering the whole of the New World and whatever was most desirable in
the Old, should surpass in glory and power the empire of the Cæsars in
the days of its palmiest supremacy.</p>

<p>This magnificent result was a matter of such general faith, that
men often felt a desire to contribute their personal exertions to
accomplish it. Not only the high nobility of Spain, therefore, but
all cavaliers and men of honor who sought distinction, saw, with the
exception of places in the civil administration of affairs or in the
Church, no road open before them on which they were so much tempted
to enter as that of military enterprise. Laborious occupation in the
business of common life and practical and productive industry were,
in consequence, discountenanced, or held in contempt, while the
armies were thronged, and multitudes of gentlemen and men of culture,
like Cervantes and Lope de Vega, gladly served in them as simple
soldiers.</p>

<p>But large as were the armies of Charles the Fifth and Philip the
Second, all who desired it could not be soldiers. Many persons of
decent condition, therefore, remained idle, because they found no
occupation which was not deemed below their rank in society; while
others, having made an experiment of military life sufficient to
disgust them with its hardships, returned home<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_57">[p. 57]</span> unfitted for every thing else. These two
sorts of persons formed a class of idlers that hung loose upon society
in the principal cities of Spain, thriving at best by flattery and low
intrigue, and sometimes driven for subsistence to crime. Their number
was by no means small. They were known and marked wherever they went;
and their characters, represented with much spirit, and often with
great faithfulness, are still to be recognized in the proud, starving
cavaliers of Mendoza and Quevedo, who stalk about the streets upon
adventure, or crowd the antechamber of the minister, and weary his
patience with their abject supplications for the meanest places it is
in his power to bestow.</p>

<p>But there was yet another body of persons in Spain, nearly akin
to the last in spirit, though differing from them in their original
position, who figure no less in this peculiar form of fiction. They
were the active, the shrewd, and the unscrupulous of the lower portions
of society;—men who were able to perceive that the resources and power
of the country, with all the advantages they desired to reach, were
already in possession of an aristocratic caste, who looked to them for
nothing but a sincere and faithful loyalty. During a long period,—the
period of danger and trouble at home,—the fidelity of this class had
been complete and unhesitating; bringing with it little feeling of
wrong, and perhaps no sense of degradation; for such men, in such
times, claimed from their superiors only protection, and, receiving
this, asked for nothing else.</p>

<p>At last, however, other prospects opened upon them. Peace came
gradually, as the Moors were driven out; and with it came a sense
of independence and personal rights, which sometimes expressed
itself in social restlessness, as in the frequent troubles at the
universities;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[p. 58]</span> and
sometimes, as in the wars of the <i>Comuneros</i>, in open rebellion.
Contemporary, too, with these upward struggles of the masses of the
people, which were always successfully rebuked and repressed, came the
conquests in America, pouring such floods of wealth as the world had
never before seen upon a country that had for ages been one of the
poorest and most suffering in Europe. The easily got treasure—which
was at first only in the hands of military adventurers or of those
who had obtained grants of office and territory in the New World—was
scattered as lightly as it was won. The shrewd and unprincipled of
the less favored classes, therefore, soon learned to gather round its
possessors, as they came home with their tempting burdens, and found
ready means to profit by the golden shower that fell on all sides, with
a profusion which carried an unhealthy action through every division
of society. Little, however, could be obtained by men so humble and
in a position so false, except by the arts of cunning and flattery.
Cunning and flattery, therefore, were soon called forth among them in
great abundance. The wealth of the Indies was a rich compost, that
brought up parasites and rogues with other noxious weeds; and Paul, the
son of a barber, and nephew of a hangman; Cortadillo, a young thief,
whose father was a village tailor; and Little Lazarus, who could never
settle his genealogy to his own satisfaction, became, in the literature
of their country, the permanent representatives of their class;—a
class well known under the degrading name of the <i>Catariberas</i>,<a
id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> or the
gayer one of <i>Pícaros</i>.</p>

<p>The first instance of a fiction founded on this state of things
was, as we have already seen, the “Lazarillo de<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_59">[p. 59]</span> Tórmes” of Mendoza, which was published as
early as 1554; a bold, unfinished sketch of the life of a rogue, from
the very lowest condition in society. This was followed, forty-five
years afterwards, by the “Guzman de Alfarache” of Mateo Aleman, the
most ample portraiture of the class to which it belongs that is to be
found in Spanish literature. What induced Aleman to write it we do not
know. Indeed, we know little about him, except that he was a native of
Seville, and wrote three or four other works of less consequence than
this tale; that he was long employed in the treasury department of the
government, and subjected to a vexatious suit at law in consequence of
it; and that at last, retiring of his own choice to private life, he
visited Mexico in 1609, and devoted the remainder of his days, either
there or in Spain, to letters.<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93"
class="fnanchor">[93]</a> He may, at some period, have been a soldier;
for one of his friends, in a eulogium prefixed to the second part of
“Guzman de Alfarache,” sums up his character by saying that “never
soldier had a poorer purse or a richer heart, or a life more unquiet
and full of trouble, than his was; and all because he accounted it a
greater honor to be a poor philosopher than a rich flatterer.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[p. 60]</span></p> <p>But
whatever he may have been, or whatever he may have suffered, his claims
to be remembered are now centred in his “Guzman de Alfarache.” As it
has reached us, it is divided into two parts, the first of which was
published at Madrid, in 1599. Its hero, who supposed himself to be the
son of a decayed and not very reputable Genoese merchant established
at Seville, escapes, as a boy, from his mother, after his father’s
ruin and death, and plunges into the world upon adventure. He soon
finds himself at Madrid, though not till he has passed through the
hands of the officers of justice; and there undergoes all sorts of
suffering, serving as a scullion to a cook, and as a ragged errand-boy
to whomsoever would employ him; until, seizing a good opportunity, he
steals a large sum of money that had been intrusted to him, and escapes
to Toledo, where he sets up for a gentleman. But there he becomes, in
his turn, the victim of a cunning like his own; and, finding his money
nearly gone, enlists for the Italian wars. His star is now on the wane.
At Barcelona, he again turns sharper and thief. At Genoa and Rome, he
sinks to the lowest conditions of a street beggar. But a cardinal picks
him up in the last city and makes him his page; a place in which, but
for his bold frauds and tricks, he might long have thriven, and which
at last he leaves in great distress, from losses at play, and enters
the service of the French ambassador.</p>

<p>Here the first part ends. It was very successful; falling in with
the vices and humors of the times, just as the loose court of Philip
the Third, and the corrupting influences of his favorite, the Duke
of Lerma, came to offer a sort of carnival to folly and vice, after
the hypocrisy and constraints of the last dark years of Philip the
Second. The Guzman, therefore, within a twelve<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_61">[p. 61]</span>-month after it appeared, passed through
three editions; and, in less than six years, through twenty-six,
besides being translated into French and Italian.<a id="FNanchor_94"
href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> It was imitated, too,
in a second part by some unknown person, probably by Juan Marti, a
Valencian advocate, who disguised himself under the name of Mateo
Luxan de Sayavedra, and published in 1603 what he boldly called a
continuation of the Guzman.<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95"
class="fnanchor">[95]</a> But it was a base attempt, which, though not
without literary merit, brought upon its author the just reproaches of
Aleman, who intimates that his own manuscripts had been improperly used
in its composition, and the just sarcasm of Aleman’s friend, Luis de
Valdes, who exposed the meanness of the whole fraud.</p>

<p>In 1605, the genuine second part appeared.<a id="FNanchor_96"
href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> It be<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[p. 62]</span>gins with the life of Guzman
in the house of the French ambassador at Rome, where he serves in some
of the most dishonorable employments to which the great of that period
degraded their mercenary dependants. But his own follies and crimes
drive him away from a place for which he seems to have been in most
respects well fitted, and he goes to Siena. At this point in his story,
it seems to have occurred to Aleman to attack the Sayavedra who had
endeavoured to impose upon the world with a false second part of the
Guzman. He therefore introduces a person who is made thus to describe
himself:—</p>

<p>“He told me,” says Guzman, who always writes in the style of
autobiography, “he told me, that he was an Andalusian, born in Seville,
my own native city, Sayavedra by name, with papers to show that he
belonged to one of the oldest and most distinguished families among us.
Who would suspect fraud under such a fair outside? And yet it was all a
lie. He was a Valencian. I do not give his true name, for good reasons;
but what with his flowing Castilian, his good looks, and his agreeable
manners, it was impossible for me to suspect that he was a thief, a
sponge, and a cheat, who had dressed himself up in peacock’s feathers
only to obtain by falsehood such an entrance into my apartments
that he could rob me of whatever he liked.”<a id="FNanchor_97"
href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a></p>

<p>This personage, his history and adventures, fill too large a space
in the second part of the Guzman; for when once Aleman had seized
him, he seemed not to tire of inflicting punishment so soon as the
reader does of witnessing it. Sayavedra robs and cheats Guzman<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[p. 63]</span> early in this portion of
the story; but afterwards accompanies him, in an equivocal capacity,
through Milan, Bologna, and Genoa, to Spain, where, partly perhaps to
get rid of him, and partly perhaps, as Cervantes did afterwards in
the case of Don Quixote and Avellaneda, in order to end his story and
prevent his enemy from continuing it any further, Aleman brings his
victim’s life to an end.</p>

<p>The remainder of the book is filled with the adventures of Guzman
himself, which are as wild and various as possible. He becomes
a merchant at Madrid, and cheats his creditors by a fraudulent
bankruptcy. He marries, but his wife dies soon; and then he begins, as
a student at Alcalá, to prepare himself for the Church;—a consummation
of wickedness which is prevented only by his marriage a second
time. His second wife, however, leaves him at Seville, where he had
established himself, and elopes with a lover to Italy. After this, he
is reduced again to abject poverty; and, unable to live with his old,
wretched, and shameless mother, he becomes major-domo to a lady of
fortune, robs her, and is sent to the galleys, where he has the good
luck to reveal a conspiracy and is rewarded with his freedom and a full
pardon.</p>

<p>With this announcement the second part abruptly ends, not without
promising a third, which was never published, though the author, in
his Preface, says it was already written. The work, therefore, as
it has come to us, is imperfect. But it was not, on that account,
the less favored and admired. On the contrary, it was translated
and printed all over Europe, in French, in Italian, in German, in
Portuguese, in English, in Dutch, and even in Latin; a rare success,
whose secret lies partly in the age when the Guzman appeared, and
still<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[p. 64]</span> more in the
power and talent of the author.<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98"
class="fnanchor">[98]</a> The long moralizing discourses with which it
abounds, written in a pure Castilian style, with much quaintness and
point, were then admired, and saved it from censures which it could
otherwise hardly have failed to encounter. These are, no doubt, the
passages that led Ben Jonson to speak of it as</p>

<div class="poem mt1"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i6">“The Spanish Proteus, which, though writ</p>
<p class="i0">But in one tongue, was formed with the world’s wit,</p>
<p class="i0">And hath the noblest mark of a good booke,</p>
<p class="i0">That an ill man doth not securely looke</p>
<p class="i0">Upon it; but will loathe or let it passe,</p>
<p class="i0">As a deformed face doth a true glasse.”<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a></p>
</div></div>

<p class="mt1">This, however, is not its real, or at least not its
main character. The Guzman is chiefly curious and interesting because
it shows us, in the costume of the times, the life of an ingenious,
Machiavellian rogue, who is never at a loss for an expedient;
who always treats himself and speaks of himself as an honest and
respectable man; and who sometimes goes to mass and says his prayers
just before he enters on an extraordinary scheme of roguery, as if
on purpose to bring it out in more striking and brilliant relief. So
far from being a moral book, therefore, it is a very immoral one,
and Le Sage spoke in the spirit of its author, when, in the next
century, undertaking to give a new French version of it, he boasted
that he “had purged it of its superfluous moral reflections.”<a
id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[p. 65]</span></p> <p>It has,
naturally, a considerable number of episodes. That of Sayavedra has
already been noticed, as occupying a space in the work disproportionate
to every thing but the anger of its author. Another—the story of
Osmyn and Daraxa, which occurs early—is a pleasing specimen of those
half-Moorish, half-Christian fictions that are so characteristic a
portion of Spanish literature.<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101"
class="fnanchor">[101]</a> And yet another, which is placed in Spain
and in the time of the Great Constable, Alvaro de Luna, is, after all,
an Italian tale of Masuccio, used subsequently by Beaumont and Fletcher
in “The Little French Lawyer.”<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102"
class="fnanchor">[102]</a> But, on the whole, the attention of the
reader is fairly kept either upon the hero or upon the long discussions
in which the hero indulges himself, and in which he draws striking,
though not unfrequently exaggerated and burlesque, sketches of all
classes of society in Spain, as they successively pass in review before
him. At first, Aleman thought of calling his work “A Beacon-light
of Life.” The name would not have been inappropriate, and it is the
qualities implied under it—the sagacity, the knowledge of life and
character, and the acuteness of its reflections on men and manners—that
have preserved for it somewhat of its original popularity down to our
own times.</p>

<p>In 1605 another story of the same class appeared,<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[p. 66]</span> the “Pícara Justina,” or
the Crafty Justina,—again a seeming autobiography, and again a fiction
of very doubtful morality. It was written by a Dominican monk, Andreas
Perez of Leon, who was known, both before and after its appearance, as
the author of works of Christian devotion, and who had so far a sense
of the incongruity of the Pícara Justina with his religious position,
that he printed it under the assumed name of Francisco Lopez de Ubeda.
He claims to have written it when he was a student at the University
of Alcalá, but admits, that, after the appearance of the “Guzman de
Alfarache,” he made large additions to it. It is, however, in truth,
a mere imitation, and a very poor one, of Aleman. The first book is
filled with a tedious, rambling account of Justina’s ancestors, who
are barbers and puppet-showmen; and the rest consists of her own
life, brought down to the time of her first marriage, marked by few
adventures, and ending with an intimation, that, at the time of writing
it, she had already been married yet twice more; that she was then the
wife of Guzman de Alfarache; and that she should continue her memoirs
still further, in case the public should care to hear more about
her.</p>

<p>The Justina discovers little power of invention in the incidents,
which are few and not interesting. Indeed, the author himself
declares that nearly all of them were actual occurrences within his
own experience; and this circumstance, together with the meagre
“improvements,” as they are called,—or warnings against the follies
and guilt of the heroine, with which each chapter ends,—is regarded by
him as a sufficient justification for publishing a work whose tendency
is obviously mischievous. Nor is the style better than the incidents.
There is a constant effort to say witty and brilliant things; but
it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[p. 67]</span> is rarely
successful; and besides this, there is an affectation of new words and
singular phrases which do not belong to the genius and analogies of the
language, and which have caused at least one Spanish critic to regard
Perez as the first author who left the sober and dignified style of the
elder times, and, from mere caprice, undertook to invent a new one.<a
id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a></p>

<p>But though the “Pícara Justina” proved a failure, the overwhelming
popularity of “Guzman de Alfarache,” when added to that of “Lazarillo,”
rendered this form of fiction so generally welcome in Spain, that it
made its way into the ductile drama, and into the style of the shorter
tales, as we have already seen when treating of Lope de Vega and
Cervantes, and as we shall see hereafter when we come to speak of Salas
Barbadillo and Francisco de Santos. Meantime, however, the “Escudero
Marcos de Obregon” appeared; a work which has, on many accounts,
attracted attention, and which deserves to be remembered, as the best
of its kind in Spanish literature, except “Lazarillo” and “Guzman.”</p>

<p>It was written by Vicente Espinel, who was born about 1540, at
Ronda, a romantic town, boldly built in the mountain range that
stretches through the southwestern portion of the kingdom of Granada,
and pic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[p. 68]</span>turesquely
described by himself in one of the most striking of his poems.<a
id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a>
He was educated at Salamanca, and, when Lope de Vega appeared as a
poet before the public, Espinel was already so far advanced in his
own career, that the young aspirant for public favor submitted his
verses to the critical skill of his elder friend;<a id="FNanchor_105"
href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a>—a favor which
Lope afterwards returned by praises in “The Laurel of Apollo,”
more heart-felt and effective than he has usually given in that
indiscriminate eulogium of the poets of his time.<a id="FNanchor_106"
href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a></p>

<p>What was the course of Espinel’s life we do not know. It has
generally been supposed that many of its events are related in his
“Marcos de Obregon”; but though this is probable, and though some parts
of that story are evidently true, yet many others are as evidently
fictions, so that, on the whole, we are bound to regard it as a
romance, and not as an autobiography. We know, however, that Espinel’s
life in Italy was much like that of his hero; that he was a soldier in
Flanders; that he wrote Latin verses; that he published a volume of
Castilian poetry in 1591; and that he was a chaplain in Ronda, though
he lived much in Madrid, and at last died there. He was regarded as the
author of the form of verse called sometimes <i>décimas</i>, and sometimes,
after himself, <i>Espinelas</i>; and he is said to have added a fifth
string to the guitar, which soon led to the invention of the sixth,
and thus completed that truly national instrument.<a id="FNanchor_107"
href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> He died, according to
Antonio, in 1634; but according to Lope de Vega, he was not alive in
1630.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[p. 69]</span> All accounts,
however, represent him as having survived his ninetieth year,<a
id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a>
and as having passed the latter part of his life in poverty and in
unfriendly relations with Cervantes;—a fact the more observable,
because both of them enjoyed pensions from the same distinguished
ecclesiastic, the kindly old Archbishop of Toledo.<a id="FNanchor_109"
href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a></p>

<p>The “Escudero Marcos de Obregon” was first published in 1618, and
therefore appeared in the old age of its author.<a id="FNanchor_110"
href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> He presents his
hero, at once, as a person already past the middle years of life;
one of the esquires of dames, who, at that period, were personages
of humbler pretensions and graver character than those who, with the
same title, had followed the men-at-arms of old.<a id="FNanchor_111"
href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> The story of Marcos,
however, though it opens upon us, at first, with scenes later in his
life, soon returns to his youth, and nearly the whole volume is made up
of his own account of his adventures, as he related them to a hermit
whom he had known when he was a soldier in Flanders and Italy, and at
whose cell he was now accidentally detained by a storm and flood, while
on an excursion from Madrid.</p>

<p>In many particulars, his history resembles that of his<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[p. 70]</span> predecessor, Guzman de
Alfarache. It is the story of a youth who left his father’s house to
seek his fortune; became first a student and afterwards a soldier;
visited Italy; was a captive in Algiers; travelled over a large part of
Spain; and after going through a great variety of dangers and trials,
intrigues, follies, and crimes, sits down quietly in his old age to
give an account of them all, with an air as grave and self-satisfied
as if the greater part of them had not been of the most discreditable
character. It contains a moderate number of wearisome, well-written
moral reflections, intended to render its record of tricks, frauds,
and crimes more savory to the reader by contrast; but though it falls
below both the “Guzman de Alfarache” and the “Lazarillo” in the beauty
and spirit of its style, it has more life in its action than either
of them, and the series of its events is carried on with greater
rapidity, and brought to a more regular conclusion.<a id="FNanchor_112"
href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a></p> <p><span
class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[p. 71]</span></p> <p>Ten years later,
another romance of the same sort appeared. It was by Yañez y Rivera,
a physician of Segovia; who, as if on purpose to show the variety of
his talent, published two works on ascetic devotion, as well as this
<i>picaresque</i> romance; all of them remote from the cares and studies
of his regular profession. He calls his story “Alonso, the Servant of
Many Masters”; and the name is a sort of index to its contents. For it
is a history of the adventures of its hero, Alonso, in the service,
first of a military officer, then of a sacristan, and afterwards of
a gentleman, of a lawyer, and of not a few others, who happened to
be willing to employ him; and it is, in fact, neither more nor less
than a satire on the different orders and conditions of society, as
he studies them all in the houses of his different masters. It is
evidently written with experience of the world, and its Castilian
style is good; but something of its spirit is diminished by the
circumstance, that it is thrown into the form of a dialogue. When Yañez
published the first part, in 1624, he said that he had already been a
practising physician twenty-six years, and that he should print nothing
more, unless it related to the profession he followed. His success,
however, with his Alonso was too tempting. He printed, in 1626, a
second part of it, containing his hero’s adventures among the Gypsies
and in Algerine captivity, and died in 1632.<a id="FNanchor_113"
href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a></p> <p><span
class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[p. 72]</span></p> <p>Quevedo’s “Paul the
Sharper,” which we have already noticed, was published the year after
Yañez had completed his story, and did much to extend the favor with
which works of this sort were received. Castillo Solorzano, therefore,
well known at the time as a writer of popular tales and dramas,
ventured to follow him, but with less good-fortune. His “Teresa, the
Child of Tricks,” was published in 1632, and was succeeded immediately
by “The Graduate in Frauds,” of which a continuation appeared in 1634,
under the whimsical title of “The Seville Weasel, or a Hook to catch
Purses.” This last, which is an account of the adventures of the
Graduate’s daughter, proved, though it was never finished, the most
popular of Solorzano’s works, and has not only been often reprinted,
but was early translated into French, and gained a reputation in
Europe generally. All three, however, are less strictly <i>picaresque</i>
tales than the similar fictions that had preceded them;—not that they
are wanting in coarse sketches of life and caricatures as broad as
any in Guzman, but that romantic tales, ballads, and even farces, or
parts of dramas, are introduced, showing that this form of romance
was becoming mingled with others more poetical, if not more true to
the condition of manners and society at the time.<a id="FNanchor_114"
href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a></p> <p><span
class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[p. 73]</span></p> <p>Another proof of
this change is to be found in “The Pythagoric Age” of Enriquez Gomez,
first published in 1644; a book of little value, which takes the old
doctrine of transmigration as the means of introducing a succession of
pictures to serve as subjects for its satire. It begins with a poem in
irregular verse, describing the existence of the soul, first in the
body of an ambitious man; then in that of a slanderer and informer, a
coquette, a minister of state, and a favorite; and it ends with similar
sketches, half in poetry and half in prose, of a knight, a schemer,
and others. But in the middle of the book is “The Life of Don Gregorio
Guadaña,” in prose, which is a tale in direct imitation of Quevedo and
Aleman, sometimes as free and coarse as theirs are, but generally not
offending against the proprieties of life; and occasionally, as in
the scenes during a journey and in the town of Carmona, pleasant and
interesting, because it evidently gives us sketches from the author’s
own experience. Like the rest of its class, it is most successful when
it deals with such realities, and least so when it wanders off into the
regions of poetry and fiction.<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115"
class="fnanchor">[115]</a></p>

<p>But the work which most plainly shows the condition of social life
that produced all these tales, if not the work that best exhibits
their character, is “The Life<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[p.
74]</span> of Estevanillo Gonzalez,” first printed in 1646. It is the
autobiography of a buffoon, who was long in the service of Ottavio
Piccolomini, the great general of the Thirty Years’ war; but it is
an autobiography so full of fiction, that Le Sage, sixty years after
its appearance, easily changed it into a mere romance, which has
continued to be republished as such with his works ever since.<a
id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a></p>

<p>Both in the original and in the French translation, it is called
“The Life and Achievements of Estevanillo Gonzalez, the Good-natured
Fellow,” and gives an account of his travels all over Europe, and
of his adventures as courier, cook, and valet of the different
distinguished masters whom he at different times served, from the
king of Poland down to the Duke of Ossuna. Nothing can exceed the
coolness with which he exhibits himself as a liar by profession, a
constitutional coward, and an accomplished cheat, whenever he can thus
render his story more amusing;—but then, on the other hand, he is not
without learning, writes gay verses, and gives us sketches of his times
and of the great men to whom he was successively attached, that are any
thing but dull. His life, indeed, would be worth reading, if it were
only to compare his account of the battle of Nordlingen with that in
De Foe’s “Cavalier,” and his drawing of Ottavio Piccolomini with the
stately portrait of the same personage in Schiller’s “Wallenstein.”
Its faults, on the other hand, are a vain display of his knowledge;
occasional attempts at grandeur and eloquence of style, which never
succeed; and numberless<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[p.
75]</span> intolerable puns. But it shows distinctly, what we have
already noticed, that the whole class of fictions to which it belongs
had its foundation in the manners and society of Spain at the period
when they appeared, and that to this they owed, not only their success
at home, in the age of Philip the Third and Philip the Fourth, but that
success abroad which subsequently produced the Gil Blas of Le Sage,—an
imitation more brilliant than any of the originals it followed.</p>

  Form of Fiction in Spain.</span></p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was inevitable that grave fiction
suited to the changed times should appear in Spain, as well as fiction
founded on the satire of prevalent manners. But there were obstacles
in its way, and it came late. The old chronicles, so full of the same
romantic spirit, and the more interesting because they were sometimes
built up out of the older and longer-loved ballads; the old ballads
themselves, still oftener made out of the chronicles; the romances of
chivalry, which had not yet lost a popularity that, at the present
day, seems nearly incredible;—all contributed, in their respective
proportions, to satisfy the demand for books of amusement, and to
repress the appearance and limit the success of serious and historical
fiction. But it was inevitable that it should come, even if it should
win little favor.</p>

<p>We have already noticed the attempts to introduce it, made in
the time of Ferdinand and Isabella, by Diego de San Pedro and his
imitator, the anonymous author of “The Question of Love.” Others
followed, in the reign of Charles the Fifth. The story, that very
imperfectly connects the discussions between Aurelio and Isabella,
on the inquiry, whether man gives more occasion for sin to woman,
or woman to man, is one of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[p.
77]</span> them. It is a slight and meagre fiction, by Juan de Mores,
which dates as far back as 1521, and which, in an early English
translation, was at one time thought to have furnished hints for
Shakspeare’s “Tempest.”<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117"
class="fnanchor">[117]</a> “The Loves of Clareo and Florisea,”
published in 1552, by Nuñez de Reinoso, at Venice, where he then lived,
is another;—a fiction partly allegorical, partly sentimental, and
partly in the manner of the romances of chivalry, but of no value for
the invention of its incidents, and of very little for its style.<a
id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> The
story of “Luzindaro and Medusina,” printed as early as 1553, which,
in the midst of enchantments and allegories, preserves the tone and
air of a series of complaints against love, and ends tragically with
the death of Luzindaro, is yet a third of these crude attempts;<a
id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a>—all
of which are of consequence only because they led the way to better
things. But excepting these and two or three more trifles of the
same kind, and of even less value, the reign of Charles the Fifth,
so far as grave fiction was concerned, was entirely given up to
the romances of chivalry.<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120"
class="fnanchor">[120]</a></p>

<p>In the reign of Philip the Second, when the literature of the
country began to develop itself on all sides, serious romances appeared
in better forms, or at least<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[p.
78]</span> with higher pretensions and attributes. Two instances of
attempts in new directions, and with more considerable success, present
themselves at once.</p>

<p>The first was by Hierónimo de Contreras, and bears the affected
title of “A Thicket of Adventures.” It was published in 1573, and is
the story of Luzuman, a gentleman of Seville, who had been bred from
childhood in great intimacy with Arboleda, a lady of equal condition
with himself; but when, as he grows up, this intimacy ripens into love,
the lady rejects his suit, on the ground that she prefers a religious
life. The refusal is gentle and tender; but he is so disheartened by
it, that he secretly leaves his home in sorrow and mortification,
and goes to Italy, where he meets with abundance of adventures, and
travels through the whole peninsula, down to Naples. Wearied with
this mode of life, he then embarks for Spain, but on his passage is
taken by a corsair and carried to Algiers. There he remains in cruel
slavery for five years. His master then gives him his freedom, and
he returns to his home as secretly as he left it; but finding that
Arboleda had taken the veil, and that the society to which he belonged
had forgotten him, and had closed over the place he had once filled, he
avoids making himself known to any body, and retires to a hermitage,
with the purpose of ending his days in devotion.<a id="FNanchor_121"
href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a></p>

<p>The whole story, somewhat solemnly divided into seven books, is
dull, from want both of sufficient variety<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_79">[p. 79]</span> in the details, and of sufficient spirit in
the style. But it is of some importance, because it is the first in a
class of fictions, afterwards numerous, which—relying on the curiosity
then felt in Spain about Italy, as a country full of Spaniards enjoying
luxuries and refinements not yet known at home, and about Algiers,
crowded with thousands of other Spaniards suffering the most severe
forms of captivity—trusted, for no small part of their interest, to
the accounts they gave of their heroes as adventurers in Italy, and as
slaves on the coast of Barbary. Lope de Vega, Cervantes, and several
more among the most popular authors of the seventeenth century, are
among the writers of fictions like these.</p>

<p>The other form of grave fiction, which appeared in the time of
Philip the Second, was the proper historical romance; and the earliest
specimen of it, except such unsuccessful and slight attempts as we have
already noticed, is to be found in “The Civil Wars of Granada,” by
Ginés Perez de Hita. The author of this striking book was an inhabitant
of Murcia, and, from the little he tells us of himself, must not only
have been familiar with the wild mountains and rich valleys of the
neighbouring kingdom of Granada, but must have had an intimate personal
acquaintance with many of the old Moorish families that still lingered
in the homes of their fathers, repeating the traditions of their
ancient glory and its disastrous overthrow. Perhaps these circumstances
led him to the choice of a subject for his romance. Certainly they
furnished him with its best materials; for the story he relates is
founded on the fall of Granada, regarded rather from within, amidst the
feuds of the Moors themselves, than, as we are accustomed to consider
it, from the Christian portion of Spain, gradually gathered in military
array outside of its walls.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[p. 80]</span>He begins his story
by seeking a safe basis for it in the origin and history of the kingdom
of Granada, according to the best authorities within his reach. This
part of his work is formal and dry, and shows how imperfect were the
notions, at the time he lived, of what an historical romance should be.
But as he advances and enters upon the main subject he had proposed
to himself, his tone changes. We are, indeed, still surrounded with
personages that are familiar to us, like the heroic Muza on one side
and the Master of Calatrava on the other; we are present with Boabdil,
the last of the long line of Moorish sovereigns, as he carries on a
fierce war against his own father in the midst of the city, and with
Ferdinand and his knights, as they lay waste all the kingdom without.
But to these historical figures are added the more imaginative and
fabulous sketches of the Zegris and Abencerrages, Reduan, Abenamar, and
Gazul, as full of knightly virtues as any of the Christian cavaliers
opposed to them; and of Haja, Zayda, and Fatima, as fair and winning as
the dames whom Isabella had brought with her to Santa Fé to cheer on
the conquest.</p>

<p>But while he is thus mingling the creations of his own fancy with
the facts of history, Hita has been particularly skilful in giving to
the whole the manners and coloring of the time. He shows us a luxurious
empire tottering to its fall, and yet, while the streets of its capital
are filled with war-cries and blood, its princes and nobles abate not
one jot of their accustomed revelry and riot. Marriage festivals and
midnight dances in the Alhambra, and gorgeous tournaments and games
in presence of the court, alternate with duels and feuds between the
two great preponderating families that are destroying the state, and
with skirmishes and single<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[p.
81]</span> combats against the advancing Christians. Then come the
cruel accusation of the Sultana by the false Zegris, and her defence
in arms by both Moors and Christians; the atrocious murder of his
sister Morayma by Boabdil, who suddenly breaks out with all the jealous
violence of an Oriental despot; and the mournful and scandalous
spectacle of three kings contending daily for empire in the squares and
palaces of a city destined in a few short weeks to fall into the hands
of the enemy that already surrounded its walls.</p>

<p>Much of this, of course, is fiction, so far as the details are
concerned; but it is not a fiction false to the spirit of the real
events on which it is founded. When, therefore, we approach the end of
the story, we come again without violence upon historical ground as
true as that on which it opened, though almost as wild and romantic
as any of the tales of feuds or festivals through which we have been
led to it. In this way, the temporary captivity of Boabdil and his
cowardly submission, the siege and surrender of Alhama and Malaga,
and the fall of Granada, are brought before us neither unexpectedly
nor in a manner out of keeping with what had preceded them; and the
story ends, if not with a regular catastrophe, which such materials
might easily have furnished, at least with a tale in the tone of all
the rest,—that which records the sad fate of Don Alonso de Aguilar.
It should be added, that not a few of the finest of the old Spanish
ballads are scattered through the work, furnishing materials for the
story, rich and appropriate in themselves, and giving an air of reality
to the events described, that could hardly have been given to them by
any thing else.</p>

<p>This first part, as it is commonly called, of the<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[p. 82]</span> Wars of Granada was written
between 1589 and 1595.<a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122"
class="fnanchor">[122]</a> It claims to be a translation from the
Arabic of a Moor of Granada, and, in the last chapter, Hita gives
a circumstantial account of the way in which he obtained it from
Africa, where, as he would have us believe, it had been carried in
the dispersion of the Moorish race. But though it is not unlikely,
that, in his wanderings through the kingdom of Granada, he may have
obtained Arabic materials for parts of his story, and though, in the
last century, it was more than once attempted to make out an Arabic
origin for the whole of it,<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123"
class="fnanchor">[123]</a> still his account, upon the face of it,
is not at all probable; besides which, he repeatedly appeals to the
chronicles of Garibay and Moncayo as authorities for his statements,
and gives to the main current of his work—especially in such passages
as the conversion of the Sultana—a Christian air, which does not
permit us to suppose that any but a Christian could have written it.
Notwithstanding his denial, therefore, we must give to Hita the honor
of being the true author of one of the most attractive books in the
prose literature of Spain; a book written in a pure, rich,<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[p. 83]</span> and picturesque style,
which seems in some respects to be in advance of the age, and in all to
be worthy of the best models of the best period.</p>

<p>In 1604, he published the second part, on a subject nearly connected
with the first. Seventy-seven years after the conquest of Granada,
the Moors of that kingdom, unable any longer to bear the oppressions
to which they were subjected by the rigorous government of Philip
the Second, took refuge in the bold range of the Alpuxarras, on the
coast of the Mediterranean, and there, electing a king, broke out into
open rebellion. They maintained themselves bravely in their mountain
fastnesses nearly four years, and were not finally defeated till three
armies had been sent against them; the last of which was commanded by
no less a general than Don John of Austria. Hita served through the
whole of this war; and the second part of his romance contains its
history. Much of what he relates is true; and, indeed, of much he had
been an eye-witness, as we can see in his accounts of the atrocities
committed in the villages of Felix and Huescar, as well as in all the
details of the siege of Galera and the death and funeral honors of Luis
de Quijada. But other portions, like the imprisonment of Albexari,
with his love for Almanzora, and the jealousies and conspiracy of
Benalguacil, must be chiefly or wholly drawn from his own imagination.
The most interesting part is the story of Tuzani, which he relates with
great minuteness, and which he declares he received from Tuzani himself
and other persons concerned in it;—a wild tale of Oriental passion,
which, as we have seen, Calderon made the subject of one of his most
powerful and characteristic dramas.</p>

<p>If the rest of the second division of Hita’s romance<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[p. 84]</span> had been like this story,
it might have been worthy of the first. But it is not. The ballads
with which it is diversified, and which are probably all his own, are
much inferior in merit to the older ballads he had inserted before;
and his narrative is given in a much less rich and glowing style.
Perhaps Hita felt the want of the old Moorish traditions that had
before inspired him, or perhaps he found himself awkwardly constrained
when dealing with facts too recent and notorious to be manageable for
the purposes of fiction. But whatever may have been the cause of its
inferiority, the fact is plain. His second part, regarded as genuine
history, is not to be compared with the account of the same events
by Diego de Mendoza; while, regarded as a romance, he had already
far surpassed it himself.<a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124"
class="fnanchor">[124]</a></p>

<p>The path, however, which Hita by these two works had opened for
historical fiction amidst the old traditions and picturesque manners
of the Moors, tempting as it may now seem, did not, in his time, seem
so to others. His own romance, it is true, was often reprinted and
much read. But, from the nature of his subject, he showed the Moorish
character on its favorable side, and even went so far as to express
his horror at the cruelties inflicted by his countrymen on their hated
enemies, and his sense of the injustice done to the vanquished by the
bad faith that kept neither the promises of Ferdinand and Isabella
nor those of Don John.<a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125"
class="fnanchor">[125]</a> Such sympathy with the infidel enemy
that had so long held Spain in fee was not according to the spirit
of the times. Only five years after Hita had<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_85">[p. 85]</span> published his account of the rebellion of
the Alpuxarras, the remainder of the Moors against whom he had there
fought were violently expelled from Spain by Philip the Third, amidst
the rejoicings of the whole Spanish people; few even of the most humane
spirits looking upon the sufferings they thus inflicted as any thing
but the just retributions of an offended Heaven.</p>

<p>Of course, while this was the state of feeling throughout the
nation, it was not to be expected that works of fiction representing
the Moors in romantic and attractive colors, and filled with adventures
drawn from their traditions, should find favor in Spain. A century
later, indeed, a third part of the Wars of Granada—whether written
by Hita or somebody else we are not told—was licensed for the press,
though never published;<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126"
class="fnanchor">[126]</a> and, in France, Madame de Scudéri soon
began, in “The Almahide,” a series of fictions on this foundation, that
has been continued down, through the “Gonsalve de Cordoue” of Florian,
to “The Abencerrage” of Chateaubriand, without giving any token that
it is likely soon to cease.<a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127"
class="fnanchor">[127]</a> But in Spain it struck no root, and had no
success.</p>

<p>Perhaps other circumstances, besides a national feeling of
unwillingness that romantic fiction should occupy the debatable
ground between the Moors and the Christians, contributed to check its
progress in Spain.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[p. 86]</span>
Perhaps the publication of the first part of Don Quixote, destroying,
by its ridicule, the only form of romance much known or regarded at
the time, was not without an effect on the other forms, by exciting a
prejudice against all grave prose works of invention, and still more by
furnishing a substitute much more amusing than they could aspire to be.
But whether this were so or not, attacks on all of them followed in the
same spirit. “The Cryselia of Lidaceli,” which appeared in 1609,—and
which, as well as a dull prose satire on the fantastic Academies
then in fashion, bears the name of Captain Flegetonte,—assails
freely whatever of prose fiction had till then enjoyed regard in
Spain, whether the pastoral, the historical, or the chivalrous.<a
id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> Its
attack, however, was so ineffectual, as to show only the tendency of
opinion to discourage romance-writing in Spain;—a tendency yet more
apparent a little later, not only in some of the best ascetic writers
of the seventeenth century, but in such works as “The Moral History of
the God Momus,” by Noydens, published in 1666, which, as its author
tells us distinctly in the Prologue, was intended to drive out of
society all novels and books of adventure whose subject was love.<a
id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[p. 87]</span>Still, serious
romance was written in Spain during the whole of the seventeenth
century, and written in several varieties of form and tone, though
with no real success. Thus, Gonzalo de Céspedes, a native of Madrid,
and author of several other works, published the first part of his
“Gerardo” in 1615, and the second in 1617. He calls it a Tragic Poem,
and divides it into discourses instead of chapters. But it is, in
fact, a prose romance, consisting of a series of slightly connected
adventures in the life of its hero, Gerardo, and episodes of the
adventures of different persons more or less associated with him; in
all which, amidst much that is sentimental and romantic, there is more
that is tragic than is common in such Spanish stories. It was several
times reprinted, and was succeeded, in 1626, by his “Various Fortunes
of the Soldier Píndaro,” a similar work, but less interesting, and
perhaps, on that account, never finished according to the original
purpose of its author. Both, however, show a power of invention which
is hardly to be found in works of the same class produced so early,
either in France or England, and both make pretensions to style,
though rather in their lighter than in their more serious portions.<a
id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a></p>

<p>Again in 1617,—the same year, it will be recollected, in which the
“Persiles and Sigismunda” of Cervantes appeared,—Francisco Loubayssin
de Lamarca, a Biscayan by birth, published his “Tragicomic History
of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[p. 88]</span> Don Enrique de
Castro”; in which known facts and fanciful adventures are mingled in
the wildest confusion. The scene is carried back, by means of the
story of the hero’s uncle, who has become a hermit in his old age, to
the Italian wars of Charles the Eighth of France, and forward, in the
person of the hero himself, to the conquest of Chili by the Spaniards;
covering meanwhile any intermediate space that seems convenient to its
author’s purposes. As an historical novel, it is an entire failure.<a
id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a></p>

<p>A similar remark may be made on another work published in 1625,
which takes in part the guise of imaginary travels, and is called “The
History of Two Faithful Friends”; a story founded on the supposed
adventures of a Frenchman and a Spaniard in Persia, and consisting
chiefly of incredible accounts of their intrigues with Persian ladies
of rank. Much of it is given in the shape of a correspondence, and
it ends with the promise of a continuation, which never appeared.<a
id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a></p>

<p>Many, indeed, of the works of fiction begun in Spain, during
the seventeenth century, remained, like the Two Faithful Friends,
unfinished, from want of encouragement and popularity; while others
that were written were never published at all.<a id="FNanchor_133"
href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> One of these last,
called “The Fortunate Knight,” by Juan Valladares de Valdelomar, of
Córdova, was quite prepared for the press in 1617, and is still extant
in the original manuscript,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[p.
89]</span> with the proper licenses for printing and the autograph
approbation of Lope de Vega. It is an historical novel, divided into
forty-five “Adventures”; and the hero, like many others of his class,
is a soldier in Italy, and a captive in Africa; serving first under
Don John of Austria, and afterwards under Sebastian of Portugal. How
much of it is true is uncertain. Regular dates are given for many of
its events, some of which can be verified; but it is full of poetry
and poetical fancies, and several of the stories, like that of the
loves of the knight himself and the fair Mayorinda, must have been
taken from the author’s imagination. Still, in the Prologue, all books
of fiction are treated with contempt, as if the whole class were so
little favored, that it was discreditable to avow the intention of
publishing another, even at the moment of doing it. In the style of
its prose, the Fortunate Knight is as good as other similar works of
the same period; but the poems with which it is crowded, to the number
of about a hundred and fifty, are of less merit.<a id="FNanchor_134"
href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a></p>

<p>The discouragement just alluded to, whether proceeding from the
ridicule thrown on long works of fiction by Cervantes, or from the
watchfulness of the ecclesiastical authorities, or from both causes
combined, was probably one of the reasons that led persons writing
serious romances to seek new directions and unwonted forms in their
composition; sometimes going as far as possible from the truth of
fact, and sometimes coming down almost to plain history. Two instances
of such deviations from the beaten paths—probably the only<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[p. 90]</span> examples in their time
of the class to which each belonged—should be noticed, for their
singularity, if not for their literary merit.</p>

<p>The first is by Cosmé de Texada, and is called “The Marvellous
Lion.” It was originally published in 1636, and consists of the history
of “the great Lion Auricrino,” his wonderful adventures, and, at
last, his marriage with Crisaura, his lady-love. It is divided into
fifty-four Apologues, which might rather have been called chapters;
and if, instead of the names of animals given to its personages, it
had such poetical names as usually occur in romantic fiction, it
would—except where it involves satirical sketches of the follies of
the times—be a mere love-romance, neither more unnatural nor more
extravagant than many of its fellows.</p>

<p>Such as it is, however, it did not entirely satisfy its author. The
early portions had been written in his youth, while he was a student in
theology at Salamanca; and when, somewhat later, he resumed his task,
and brought it to a regular conclusion, he was already far advanced in
the composition of another romance still more grave and spiritualized
and still farther removed from the realities of life. This more
carefully matured fiction is called “Understanding and Truth, the
Philosophical Lovers”; and all its personages are allegorical, filling
up, with their dreams and trials, a shadowy picture of human life, from
the creation to the general judgment. How long Texada was employed
about this cold and unsatisfactory allegory, we are not told; but it
was not published till 1673, nearly forty years after it was begun, and
then it was given to the public by his brother as a posthumous work,
with the inappropriate title of “The Second Part of the Marvellous
Lion.” Neither romance had a living interest capable of insur<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[p. 91]</span>ing it a permanent success,
but both are written in a purer style than was common in such works
at the same period, and the first of them occasionally attacks the
faults of the contemporary literature with spirit and good-humor.<a
id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a></p>

<p>Quite different from both of them, “The New Kings of Toledo,” by
Christóval Lozano, introduces only real personages, and contains little
but the facts of known history and old tradition, slightly embellished
by the spirit of romance. Its author was attached to the metropolitan
cathedral of Toledo, and, with Calderon, served in the chapel set
apart for the burial of the New Kings, as the monarchs of Castile were
called from the time of Henry of Trastamara, who there established for
himself a cemetery, separate from that in which the race ending with
the dishonored Don Pedro had been entombed.</p>

<p>The pious chaplain, who was thus called to pray daily for the souls
of the line of sovereigns that had constituted the house of Trastamara,
determined to illustrate their memories by a romantic history; and,
beginning with the old national traditions of the origin of Toledo,
the cave of Hercules, the marriage of Charlemagne with a Moorish
princess whom he converted, and the refusal of a Christian princess
to marry a Moor whom she could not convert, he gives us an account of
the building of the chapel, and the adventures of the kings who sleep
under its altars, down as late as the death of<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_92">[p. 92]</span> Henry the Third, in 1406. From internal
evidence, it was written at the end of the reign of Philip the
Fourth, when Spanish prose had lost much both of its purity and of
its dignity; but Lozano, though not free from the affectations of his
age, wrote so much more simply than his contemporaries generally did,
and his story, though little indebted to his own invention, was yet
found so attractive, that, in about half a century, eleven editions
of it were published, and it obtained for itself a place in Spanish
literature which it has never entirely lost.<a id="FNanchor_136"
href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a></p>

<p>After all, however, the serious and historical fictions produced
in Spain, that merit the name of full-length romances, were, from the
first, few in number, and, with the exception of Hita’s “Civil Wars of
Granada,” deserved little favor. Subsequent to the reign of Philip the
Fourth, they almost disappeared for above a century; and even at the
end of that period, they occurred rarely, and obtained little regard.<a

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Short</span> stories or tales were more
successful in Spain, during the latter part of the sixteenth century
and the whole of the seventeenth, than any other form of prose fiction,
and were produced in greater numbers. They seem, indeed, to have sprung
afresh, and with great vigor, from the prevailing national tastes and
manners, not at all connected with the tales of Oriental origin, that
had been introduced above two hundred years earlier by Don Juan Manuel,
and little affected by the brilliant Italian school, of which Boccaccio
was the head; but showing rather, in the hues they borrowed from the
longer contemporary pastoral, satirical, and historical romances, how
truly they belonged to the spirit of their own times, and to the state
of society in which they appeared. We turn to them, therefore, with
more than common interest.</p>

<p>The oldest Spanish tales of the sixteenth century, that deserve to
be noticed, are two that are found in a small volume of the works of
Antonio de Villegas, somewhat conceitedly called “El Inventario,” and
pre<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[p. 94]</span>pared for the
press about 1550, though not published till 1565.<a id="FNanchor_138"
href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> The first of them is
entitled “Absence and Solitude,” a pastoral consisting of about equal
portions of prose and poetry, and is as affected and in as bad taste as
the ampler fictions of the class to which it belongs. The other—“The
Story of Narvaez”—is much better. It is the Spanish version of a
romantic adventure that really occurred on the frontiers of Granada, in
the days when knighthood was in its glory among Moors as well as among
Christians. Its principal incidents are as follows.</p>

<p>Rodrigo de Narvaez, Alcayde of Alora, a fortress on the Spanish
border, grows weary of a life of inaction, from which he had been for
some time suffering, and goes out one night with a few followers, in
mere wantonness, to seek adventures. Of course they soon find what, in
such a spirit, they seek. Abindarraez, a noble Moor, belonging to the
persecuted and exiled family of the Abencerrages, comes well mounted
and well armed along the path they are watching, and sings cheerily
through the stillness of the night,—</p>

<div class="poem mt1"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">In Granada was I born,</p>
<p class="i2">In Cartama was I bred;</p>
<p class="i0">But in Coyn by Alora</p>
<p class="i2">Lives the maiden I would wed.</p>
</div></div>

<p class="mt1">A fight follows at once, and the gallant young Moor
is taken prisoner; but his dejected manner, after a resistance so
brave as he had made, surprises his conqueror, who, on inquiry, finds
that his captive was on his way that very night to a secret marriage
with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[p. 95]</span> the lady of his
love, daughter of the lord of Coyn, a Moorish fortress near at hand.
Immediately on learning this, the Spanish knight, like a true cavalier,
releases the young Moor from his present thraldom, on condition that
he will voluntarily return in three days and submit himself again to
his fate. The noble Moor keeps his word, bringing with him his stolen
bride, to whom, by the intervention of the generous Spaniard with the
king of Granada, her father is reconciled, and so the tale ends to the
honor and content of all the parties who appear in it.</p>

<p>Some passages in it are beautiful, like the first declaration of
his love by Abindarraez, as described by himself; and the darkness
that, he says, fell upon his very soul, when his lady, the next day,
was carried away by her father, “as if,” he adds, “the sun had been
suddenly eclipsed over a man wandering amidst wild and precipitous
mountains.” His Moorish honor and faith, too, are characteristically
and finely expressed, when, on the approach of the time for his return
to captivity, he reveals to his bride the pledge he had given, and in
reply to her urgent offer to send a rich ransom and break his word,
he says, “Surely I may not <i>now</i> fall into so great a fault; for
if, when formerly I came to you all alone, I kept truly my pledged
faith, my duty to keep it is doubled now that I am yours. Therefore,
questionless, I shall return to Alora, and place myself in the
Alcayde’s hands; and when I have done what I ought to do, he must also
do what to him seems right.”</p>

<p>The original story, as told by the Arabian writers, is found at
the end of “The History of the Arabs in Spain,” by Conde, who says it
was often repeated by the poets of Granada. But it was too attractive
in it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[p. 96]</span>self, and too
flattering to the character of Spanish knighthood, not to obtain a
similar place in Spanish literature. Montemayor, therefore, borrowing
it with little ceremony from Villegas, and altering it materially for
the worse in point of style, inserted it in the editions of his “Diana”
published towards the latter part of his life, though it harmonizes not
at all with the pastoral scenery which there surrounds it. Padilla,
too, soon afterwards took possession of it, and wrought it into a
series of ballads; Lope de Vega founded on it his play of “The Remedy
for Misfortune”; and Cervantes introduced it into his “Don Quixote.”
On all sides, therefore, traces of it are to be found, but it nowhere
presents itself with such grace or to such advantage as it does in
the simple tale of Villegas.<a id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139"
class="fnanchor">[139]</a></p>

<p>Juan de Timoneda, already noticed as one of the founders of the
popular theatre in Spain, was also an early writer of Spanish tales.
Indeed, as a bookseller<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[p.
97]</span> who sought to make profit of whatever was agreeable
to the general taste, and who wrote and published in this spirit
several volumes of ballads, miscellaneous poetry, and farces, it was
quite natural he should adventure in the ways of prose fiction, now
become so attractive. His first attempt seems to have been in his
“Patrañuelo,” or Story-teller, the first part of which appeared in
1576, but was not continued.<a id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140"
class="fnanchor">[140]</a></p>

<p>It is a small work, which draws its materials from widely different
sources, some of them being found, like the well-known story of
Apollonius, Prince of Tyre, in the “Gesta Romanorum,” and some in the
Italian masters, like the story of Griselda in Boccaccio, and the
one familiar to English readers in the ballad of “King John and the
Abbot of Canterbury,” which Timoneda probably took from Sacchetti.<a
id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> Three
or four—of which the first in the volume is one—had already been used
in the construction of dramas by Alonso de la<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_98">[p. 98]</span> Vega and Lope de Rueda. All of them tend
to show, what is proved in other ways, that such popular stories had
long been a part of the intellectual amusements of a state of society
little dependent on books; and, after floating for centuries up and
down through the different countries of Europe,—borne by a general
tradition or by the minstrels and <i>Trouveurs</i>,—were about this period
first reduced to writing, and then again passed onward from hand to
hand, till they were embodied in some form that became permanent. What,
therefore, the <i>Novellieri</i> had been doing in Italy for above two
hundred years, Timoneda now undertook to do for Spain. The twenty-two
tales of his “Patrañuelo” are not, indeed, connected, like those of the
“Decamerone,” but he has given them a uniform character by investing
them all with his own easy, if not very pure, style; and thus, without
anticipating it, sent them out anew to constitute a part of the settled
literature of his country, and to draw after them a long train of
similar fictions, some of which bear the most eminent names known among
those of Spanish prose-writers.</p>

<p>Indeed, the very next is of this high order. It is that of
Cervantes, who began by inserting such stories in the first part
of his “Don Quixote” in 1605, and, eight years later, produced a
collection of them, which he published separately. Of these tales,
however, we have already spoken, and will, therefore, now only repeat,
that, for originality of invention and happiness of style, they stand
at the head of the class to which they belong.<a id="FNanchor_142"
href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a></p>

<p>Others followed, of very various character. Hidalgo published,
in 1605, an account of the frolics permitted<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_99">[p. 99]</span> during the last three days of Carnival, in
which are many short tales and anecdotes, like the slightest and gayest
of the Italian <i>novelle</i>;<a id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143"
class="fnanchor">[143]</a> and Suarez de Figueroa, who was no friend
of Cervantes, if he was his follower, inserted other tales of a more
romantic tone in his “Traveller,” which he published in 1617.<a
id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a>
Perhaps, however, no writer of such fictions in the early part of the
seventeenth century had more success than Salas Barbadillo, who was
born at Madrid, about 1580, and died in 1630.<a id="FNanchor_145"
href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> During the last
eighteen years of his life, he published not less than twenty different
works, all of which, except three or four that are filled with such
dramas and poetry as Lope de Vega had made fashionable, consist of
popular stories, neither so short as the tales of Timoneda, nor long
enough to be accounted regular romances, but all written in a truly
national spirit, and in a strongly marked Castilian style.</p>

<p>“The Ingenious Helen, Daughter of Celestina,” which is one of the
earliest and most spirited of these fictions, appeared in 1612, and was
frequently printed afterwards. It is the story of a courtesan, whose
ad<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[p. 100]</span>ventures, from
the high game she undertakes to play in life, are of the boldest and
most desperate kind. She is called the daughter of Celestina, because
she is made to deserve that name by her talent and her crimes; but,
with instinctive truth, she is at last left to perish by the most
disgraceful of all the forms of a Spanish execution, for poisoning
an obscure and vulgar lover. One or two minor stories are rather
inartificially introduced in the course of the main narrative, and
so are a few ballads, which have no value except as they serve to
illustrate the ruffian life, as it was called, then to be found in the
great cities of Spain. The best parts of the book are those relating
to Helen herself and her machinations; and the most striking scenes,
and perhaps the most true to the time, are those that occur when she
rises to the height of her fortunes by setting up for a saint and
imposing on all Seville.<a id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146"
class="fnanchor">[146]</a></p>

<p>Of course, with such materials and incidents, the Helena takes much
of its tone from the stories in the <i>gusto picaresco</i>, or the style
of Spanish rogues. Quite opposite to it, therefore, in character and
purpose, is “The Perfect Knight,”—a philosophical tale, not without
some touch of the romances of chivalry. It is addressed to all the
noble youth of the realm, at a time when the Cortes were assembled,
and is intended to set the ideal of true knighthood before them, as
before an audience the younger part of which might be excited to strive
after its attributes and honors. To accomplish this, Barbadillo gives
the history of a Spanish cavalier, who, travelling to Italy during
the reign of Alfonso of Aragon, the conqueror of Naples, obtains the
favor of that monarch, and, after serving him in the highest mil<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[p. 101]</span>itary and diplomatic
posts,—commanding armies in Germany, and mediating between imaginary
kings of England and Ireland,—retires to the neighbourhood of Baia
and enjoys a serene and religious old age.<a id="FNanchor_147"
href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a></p>

<p>Again, “The House of Respectable Amusements” differs from both of
the preceding fictions, and exhibits another variety of their author’s
very flexible talent. It relates the frolics of four gay students of
Salamanca, who, wearied by their course of life at the University,
come to Madrid, open a luxurious house, arrange a large hall for
exhibitions, and invite the rank and fashion of the city, telling
stories for the amusement of their guests, reciting ballads, and acting
plays;—all of which constitute the materials that fill the volume. Six
tales, however, are really the effective part of it; and the whole is
abruptly terminated by the dangerous illness of the most active among
the four gay cavaliers who had arranged these Lenten entertainments.<a
id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a></p>

<p>But it is not necessary to examine further the light fictions of
Barbadillo. It is enough to say of the rest, that “The Point-Device
Knight,” in two parts, is a grotesque story in ridicule of those
who pretend to be first in every thing;<a id="FNanchor_149"
href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a>—that “The Lucky Fool”
is what its name implies;<a id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150"
class="fnanchor">[150]</a>—that “Don Diego” consists of the
love-adventures, during nine successive nights, of a gen<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[p. 102]</span>tleman who always fails
in what he undertakes;<a id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151"
class="fnanchor">[151]</a>—and that all of them, and all Barbadillo’s
other productions, are within the range of talent of not a very high
order, but uncommonly flexible, and dealing rather with the surface
of manners than with the secrets of character which manners serve to
hide. His latest work, entitled “Parnassian Crowns and Dishes for the
Muses,” consists of a medley of verse and prose, stories and dramas,
which were arranged for the press, and licensed in October, 1630; but
he died immediately afterwards, and they were not printed till 1635.<a
id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a></p>

<p>During the life of Barbadillo, and probably in some degree from
his example and success, such fictions became frequent. “The Winter
Evenings” of Antonio de Eslava, published in 1609, belong to this
class, but are, indeed, so early in their date, that they may have
rather given an impulse to Barbadillo than received one from him.<a
id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a>
But “The Twelve Moral Tales” of Diego de Agreda, in 1620, belong
clearly to his manner,<a id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154"
class="fnanchor">[154]</a> as does also “The Guide and Counsel
for Strangers at Court,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[p.
103]</span>” published the same year, by Liñan y Verdugo,—a singular
series of stories, related by two elderly gentlemen to a young man,
in order to warn him against the dangers of a gay life at Madrid.<a
id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> Lope
de Vega, as usual, followed where success had already been obtained
by others. In 1621, he added a short tale to his “Philomena,” and, a
little later, three more to his “Circe”; but he himself thought them
a doubtful experiment, and they, in fact, proved an unhappy one.<a
id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a>
Other persons, however, encouraged by the general favor that evidently
waited on light and amusing collections of stories, crowded more
earnestly along in the same path;—Salazar, with his “Flowers of
Recreation,” in 1622;<a id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157"
class="fnanchor">[157]</a>—Lugo, with his “Novelas,” the same year;<a
id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a>—and
Camerino, with his “Love Tales,”<a id="FNanchor_159"
href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> only a year later;—all
the last six works having been produced in three years, and all
belonging to the school of Timoneda, as it had been modified by the
genius of Cervantes and the practical skill of Salas Barbadillo.</p>

<p>This was popular success; but it was so much in one direction,
that its results became a little monotonous.<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_104">[p. 104]</span> Variety, therefore, was soon demanded;
and, being demanded by the voice of fashion, it was soon obtained.
The new form, thus introduced, was not, however, a violent change. It
was made by a well-known dramatic author, who—taking a hint from the
“Decamerone,” already in part adopted by Barbadillo, in his “House of
Respectable Amusements”—substituted a theatrical framework to connect
his separate stories, instead of the merely narrative one used by
Boccaccio and his followers. This fell in, happily, with the passion
for the stage which then pervaded all Spain, and it was successful.</p>

<p>The change referred to is first found in the “Cigarrales de
Toledo,” published in 1624, by Gabriel Tellez, who, as we have already
observed, when he left his convent and came before the public as a
secular author, always disguised himself under the name of Tirso de
Molina. It is a singular book, and takes its name from a word of
Arabic origin peculiar to Toledo; <i>Cigarral</i> signifying there a small
country-house in the neighbourhood of the city, resorted to only for
recreation and only in the summer season. At one of these houses Tirso
supposes a wedding to have happened, under circumstances interesting
to a large number of persons, who, wishing in consequence of it to
be much together, agreed to hold a series of entertainments at their
different houses, in an order to be determined by lot and under the
superintendence of one of their company, each of whom, during the
single day of his authority, should have supreme control and be
responsible for the amusements of the whole party.</p>

<p>The “Cigarrales de Toledo” is an account of these entertainments,
consisting of stories that were read or related at them, poetry that
was recited, and plays that were acted,—in short, of all that made
up the various<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[p. 105]</span>
exhibitions and amusements of the party. Some portions of it are fluent
and harmonious beyond the common success of the age; but in general, as
in the descriptions and in the poor contrivance of the “Labyrinth,” it
is disfigured by conceits and extravagances, belonging to the follies
of Gongorism. The work, however, pleased, and Tirso himself prepared
another of the same kind, called “Pleasure and Profit,”—graver and more
religious in its tone, but of less poetical merit,—which was written in
1632, and printed in 1635. But, though both were well received, neither
was finished. The last ends with the promise of a second part, and
the first, which undertakes to give an account of the entertainments
of twenty days, embraces, in fact, only five.<a id="FNanchor_160"
href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a></p>

<p>The style they adopted was soon imitated. Montalvan, who, like his
master, never failed to follow the indications of the popular taste,
printed, in 1632, his “Para Todos,” or For Everybody, containing the
imaginary amusements of a party of literary friends, who agreed to
cater for each other during a week, and whose festivities are ended, as
those of the “Cigarrales” began, with a wedding. Some of its inventions
are very learnedly dull, and it is throughout less well arranged than
the account of the entertainments near Toledo, and falls less naturally
into a dramatic framework. But it shows its author’s talent. The
individual stories are pleasantly told, especially the one called “At
the End of the Year One Thousand”; and, as a whole, the “Para Todos”
was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[p. 106]</span> popular, going
through nine editions in less than thirty years, notwithstanding
a very severe attack on it by Quevedo.<a id="FNanchor_161"
href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> Its popularity, too,
had the natural effect of producing imitations, among which, in
1640, appeared, “Para Algunos,”—For a Few,—by Matias de los Reyes;<a
id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a>
and, somewhat later, “Para Sí,”—For one’s own Self,—by Juan
Fernandez y Peralta.<a id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163"
class="fnanchor">[163]</a></p>

<p>Meantime the succession of separate tales had been actively kept
up. Montalvan published eight in 1624, written with more than the
usual measure of grace in such Spanish compositions; one of them,
“The Disastrous Friendship,” founded on the sufferings of an Al<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[p. 107]</span>gerine captivity, being
one of the best in the language, and all of them so successful,
that they were printed eleven times in about thirty years.<a
id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a>
Céspedes y Meneses followed, in 1628, with a series entitled
“Rare Histories”;<a id="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165"
class="fnanchor">[165]</a>—Moya, at about the same time, published
a single whimsical story on “The Fancies of a Fright”; in which he
relates a succession of marvellous incidents, that, as he declares,
flashed through his own imagination while falling down a precipice
in the Sierra Morena;<a id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166"
class="fnanchor">[166]</a>—and Castro y Anaya published, in 1632,
five tales called “The Auroras of Diana,” because they are told
in the early dawn of each morning, during five successive days,
to amuse Diana, a lady who, after a long illness, had fallen into
a state of melancholy.<a id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167"
class="fnanchor">[167]</a></p>

<p>The fair sex, too, entered into the general fashionable competition.
Mariana de Carbajal, a native of Granada, and descended from the
ancient ducal families of San Carlos and Rivas, published, in
1638, eight tales, pleasing both by their invention and by the
simplicity of their style, which she called “Christmas at Madrid,”
or “Evening Amusements.”<a id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168"
class="fnanchor">[168]</a> And in 1637 and 1647, Ma<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[p. 108]</span>ría de Zayas, a lady of
the court, printed two collections; the first called simply “Tales,”
and the last “Saraos,” or Balls; each a series of ten stories within
itself, and both connected together by the entertainments of a party of
friends at Christmas, and the dances and <i>fêtes</i> at the wedding of two
of their number, during the holidays that followed.<a id="FNanchor_169"
href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a></p>

<p>Again, slight changes in such fictions were attempted. Mata,
in two dull tales, called “The Solitudes of Aurelia,” published
in 1637, endeavoured to give them a more religious character;<a
id="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> and
in 1641, André del Castillo, in six stories misnamed “The Masquerade
of Taste,” sought to give them even a lighter tone than the old one.<a
id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a>
Both found successors. Lozano’s “Solitudes of Life,” which are four
stories supposed to be told by a hermit on the wild peaks of the
Monserrate, belong to the first class, and, notwithstanding a somewhat
affected style, were much praised by Calderon, and went through
at least six editions;<a id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172"
class="fnanchor">[172]</a>—while, in the opposite direction, between
1625 and 1640, we have a number of the freest secular tales, by
Castillo Solorzano, among which the best are probably “The Alleviations
of Cassandra,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[p. 109]</span>” and
“The Country-House of Laura,” both imitations of Castro’s “Diana.”<a
id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a></p>

<p>In the same way, the succession of short fictions was continued
unbroken, until it ceased with the general decay of Spanish literature
at the end of the century. Thus we have, in 1641, “The Various Effects
of Love and Fortune,” by Alonso de Alcalá; five stories, such as may
be imagined from the fact, that, in each of them, one of the five
vowels is entirely omitted;<a id="FNanchor_174" href="#Footnote_174"
class="fnanchor">[174]</a>—in 1645, “The Warnings, or Experiences, of
Jacinto,” by Villalpando, which may have been taken from his own life,
since Jacinto was the first of his own names;<a id="FNanchor_175"
href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a>—in 1663, “The
Festivals of Wit and Entertainments of Taste,” by Andres de Prado;<a
id="FNanchor_176" href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a>—and,
in 1666, a series collected from different authors, by
Isidro de Robles,<a id="FNanchor_177" href="#Footnote_177"
class="fnanchor">[177]</a> and published under the title of “Wonders
of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[p. 110]</span> Love.” All
these, as their names indicate, belong to one school; and although
there is an occasional variety in their individual tones, some of
them being humorous and others sentimental, and although some of them
have their scenes in Spain and others in Italy or Algiers, still, as
the purpose of all was only the lightest amusement, they may all be
grouped together and characterized in the mass, as of little value, and
as falling off in merit the nearer they approach the period when such
fictions ceased in the elder Spanish literature.</p>

<p>One more variety in the characteristics of this style of writing
in Spain is, however, so distinct from the rest, that it should
be separately mentioned,—that which has sometimes been called the
Allegorical and Satirical Tale, and which generally took the form
of a Vision. It was, probably, suggested by the bold and original
“Visions” of Quevedo; and the instance of it most worthy of notice is
“The Limping Devil” of Luis Velez de Guevara, which appeared in 1641.
It is a short story, founded on the idea that a student releases from
his confinement, in a magician’s vial, the Limping Devil, who, in
return for this service, carries his liberator through the air, and,
unroofing, as it were, the houses of Madrid, during the stillness
of the night, shows him the secrets that are passing within. It is
divided into ten “Leaps,” as they afterwards spring from place to place
in different parts of Spain, in order to pounce on their prey, and
it is satirical throughout. Parts of it are very happy; among which
may be selected those relating to fashionable life, to the life of
rogues, and to that of men of letters, in the large cities of Castile
and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[p. 111]</span> Andalusia,
though these, like the rest, are often disfigured with the bad taste
then so common. On the whole, however, it is an amusing fiction,—partly
allegorical and partly sketched from living manners,—and is to be
placed among the more spirited prose satires in modern literature, both
in its original form and in the form given to it by Le Sage, whose
<i>rifacimento</i> has carried it, under the name of “Le Diable Boiteux,”
wherever letters are known.<a id="FNanchor_178" href="#Footnote_178"
class="fnanchor">[178]</a></p>

<p>Earlier than the appearance of the Limping Devil, however, Polo had
written his “Hospital of Incurables,” a direct, but poor, imitation
of Quevedo; and in 1647, under an assumed name, he published his
“University of Love, or School for Selfishness,” a satire against
mercenary matches, thrown into the shape of a vision of the University
of Love, where the fair sex are brought up in the arts of profitable
intrigue, and receive degrees according to their progress.<a
id="FNanchor_179" href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> It
is, in general, an ill-managed allegory, filled with bad puns and worse
verse; but there is one passage so characteristic of Spanish wit in
this form of fiction, that it may be cited as an illustration of the
entire class to which it belongs.</p>

<p>“‘That young creature whom you see there,’ said the<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[p. 112]</span> God of Love, as he led
me on, ‘is the chief captain of my war, the one that has brought most
soldiers to my feet and enlisted most men under my banners. The elderly
person that is leading her along by the hand is her aunt.’ ‘Her <i>aunt</i>,
did you say?’ I replied; ‘her <i>aunt</i>? Then there is an end of all my
love for her. That word <i>aunt</i> is a counter poison that has disinfected
me entirely, and quite healed the wound your well-planted arrow was
beginning to make in my heart. For, however much a man may be in love,
there can be no doubt an <i>aunt</i> will always be enough to purge him
clean of it. Inquisitive, suspicious, envious,—one or the other she
cannot fail to be,—and if the niece have the luck to escape, the lover
never has; for if she is envious, she wants him for herself; and if
she is only suspicious, she still spoils all comfort, so disconcerting
every little project, and so disturbing every little nice plan, as to
render pleasure itself unsavory,’ ‘Why, what a desperately bad opinion
you have of aunts!’ said Love. ‘To be sure I have,’ said I. ‘If the
state of innocence in which Adam and Eve were created had nothing
else to recommend it, the simple fact that there could have been no
<i>aunts</i> in Paradise would have been enough for me. Why, every morning,
as soon as I get up, I cross myself and say, “By the sign of the Holy
Rood, from all aunts deliver us this day, Good Lord!” And every time I
repeat the <i>Paternoster</i>, after “Lead us not into temptation,” I always
add,—“nor into the way of aunts either.”’”</p>

<p>The example of Quevedo was, again, followed by Marcos Garcia, who
in 1657 published his “Phlegm of Pedro Hernandez,” an imaginary,
but popular, personage, whose arms, according to an old Spanish
proverb, fell out of their sockets from the mere listlessness of<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[p. 113]</span> their owner. It is
a vision, in which women-servants who spend their lives in active
cheating, students pressing vigorously forward to become quacks and
pettifoggers, spendthrift soldiers, and similar uneasy, unprincipled
persons of other conditions, are contrasted with those who, trusting
to a quiet disposition, float noiselessly down the current of
life, and succeed without an effort and without knowing how they
do it. The general allegory is meagre; but some of the individual
sketches are well imagined.<a id="FNanchor_180" href="#Footnote_180"
class="fnanchor">[180]</a></p>

<p>The person, however, who, in the latter part of the seventeenth
century, succeeded best in this style of composition, as well as in
tales of other kinds, was Francisco Santos, a native of Madrid, who
died not far from the year 1700. Between 1663 and 1697, he gave to
the world sixteen volumes of different kinds of works for popular
amusement;—generally short stories, but some of them encumbered
with allegorical personages and tedious moral discussions.<a
id="FNanchor_181" href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a>
The oldest of the series, “Dia y Noche en Madrid,” or, as it may be
translated, Life in Madrid, though a mere fiction founded on manners,
is divided into what the author terms Eighteen Discourses. It opens, as
such Spanish tales are too apt to open, somewhat pompously; the first
scene de<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[p. 114]</span>scribing
with too much elaborateness a procession of three hundred emancipated
captives, who enter Madrid praising God and rejoicing at their release
from the horrors of Algerine servitude. One of these captives, the hero
of the story, falls immediately into the hands of a shrewd and not
over-honest servant, named Juanillo, who, having begun the world as a
beggar, and risen by cunning so far as to be employed in the capacity
of an inferior servant by a fraternity of monks, now undertakes to
make the stranger acquainted with the condition of Madrid, serving
him as a guide wherever he goes, and interpreting to him whatever is
most characteristic of the manners and follies of the capital. Some
of the tales and sketches thus introduced are full of life and truth,
as, for instance, those relating to the prisons, gaming-houses, and
hospitals, and especially one in which a coquette, meeting a poor man
at a bull-fight, so dupes him by her blandishments, that she sends him
back penniless, at midnight, to his despairing wife and children, who,
anxious and without food, have been waiting from the early morning to
have him return with their dinner. This little volume, several parts
of which have been freely used by Le Sage, ends with an account of
the captive’s adventures in Italy, in Spain, and in Algiers, given
by himself in a truly national tone, and with fluency and spirit.<a
id="FNanchor_182" href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a></p>

<p>“Periquillo”—another of these collections of sketches and tales,
less well written than the last, except in the merely narrative
portions—contains an account of a foundling, who, after the ruin
and death of a pious couple that first picked him up at their door
on a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[p. 115]</span> Christmas
morning, begins the world for himself as the leader of a blind beggar.
From this condition, which, in such Spanish stories, always seems to
be regarded as the lowest possible in society, he rises to be the
servant of a cavalier, who proves to be a mysterious robber, and after
escaping from whom he falls into the hands of yet worse persons, and
is apprehended under circumstances that remind us of the story of
Doña Mencia in “Gil Blas.” He, however, vindicates his innocence,
and, being released from the fangs of justice, returns, weary of the
world, to his first home, where he leads an ascetic life; makes long,
pedantic discourses on virtue to his admiring townsmen; and proves, in
fact, a sort of humble philosopher, growing constantly more and more
devout till the account of him ends at last with a prayer. The whole
is interesting among Spanish works of fiction, because it is evidently
written both in imitation of the <i>picaresque</i> novels and in opposition
to them; since Periquillo, from the lowest origin, gets on by neither
roguery nor cleverness, but by honesty and good faith; and, instead of
rising in the world and becoming rich and courtly, settles patiently
down into a village hermit, or a sort of poor Christian Diogenes.
No doubt, he has neither the wit nor the cunning of Lazarillo; but
that he should venture to encounter that shrewd little beggar in any
way makes Periquillo, at once, a personage of some consequence.<a
id="FNanchor_183" href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a></p>

<p>Yet one more of the works of Santos should be noticed; an
allegorical tale, called “Truth on the Rack, or the Cid come to Life
again.” Its general story is, that Truth, in the form of a fair woman,
is placed on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[p. 116]</span> the
rack, surrounded by the Cid and other forms, that rise from the earth
about the scaffold on which she is tormented. There she is forced to
give an account of things as they really exist, or have existed, and
to discourse concerning shadowy multitudes, who pass, in sight of
the company that surrounds her, over what seems to be a long bridge.
The whole is, therefore, a satire in the form of a vision, but its
character is consistently sustained only at the beginning and the
end. The Cid, however, is much the same personage throughout,—bold,
rough, and free-spoken. He is heartily dissatisfied with every thing
he finds on earth, especially with the popular traditions and ballads
about himself, and goes back to his grave well pleased to escape from
such a world, “which,” he says, “if they would give it to me to live
in, I would not accept.”<a id="FNanchor_184" href="#Footnote_184"
class="fnanchor">[184]</a></p>

<p>Other works of Santos, like “The Devil let loose, or Truths of
the other World dreamed about in this,” and “The Live Man and the
Dead One,” are of the same sort with the last;<a id="FNanchor_185"
href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> while yet others
run even more to allegory, like his “Tarascas de Madrid,”<a
id="FNanchor_186" href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> and
his “Gi<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[p. 117]</span>gantones,”<a
id="FNanchor_187" href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a>
suggested by the huge and unsightly forms led about to amuse or
to frighten the multitude in the annual processions of the Corpus
Christi;—the satirical interpretation he gives to them being, that
worse monsters than the Tarascas might be seen every day in Madrid by
those who could distinguish the sin and folly that always thronged
the streets of that luxurious capital. But though such satires were
successful when they first appeared, they have long since ceased to be
so; partly because they abound in allusions to local circumstances now
known only to the curiosity of antiquarians, and partly because, in all
respects, they depict a state of society and manners of which hardly a
vestige remains.</p>

<p>Santos is the last of the writers of Spanish tales previous to
the eighteenth century that needs to be noticed.<a id="FNanchor_188"
href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> But though the
number we have gone over is large for the length of the period in
which they appeared, not a few others might be added. The pastoral
romances from the time of Montemayor are full of them;—the “Galatea”
of Cervantes, and the “Arcadia” of Lope de Vega, being little more
than a series of such stories, slightly bound together by yet another
that connects them all. So are, to a certain degree, the <i>picaresque</i>
fictions, like “Guzman de Alfarache” and “Marcos de Obregon”;—and so
are such serious fictions as “The Wars of Granada” and “The Spanish
Gerardo.” The popular drama, too, was near akin to the whole; as<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[p. 118]</span> we have seen in the
case of Timoneda, whose stories, before he produced them as tales,
had already been exhibited in the form of farces on the rude stage of
the public squares; and in the case of Cervantes, who not only put
part of his tale of “The Captive” in “Don Quixote” into his second
play of “Life in Algiers,” but constructed his story of “The Liberal
Lover” almost wholly out of his earlier play on the same subject.
Indeed, Spain, during the period we have gone over, was full of the
spirit of this class of fictions,—not only producing them in great
numbers, and strongly marked with the popular character, but carrying
their tone into the longer romances and upon the stage to a degree
quite unknown elsewhere.<a id="FNanchor_189" href="#Footnote_189"
class="fnanchor">[189]</a></p>

<p>The most striking circumstance, however, connected with the history
of all romantic fiction in Spain,—whatever form it assumed,—is its
early appearance, and its early decay. The story of “Amadis” filled the
world with its fame, when no other Spanish prose romance of chivalry
was heard of; and, what is singular, though the oldest of its class,
it still remains the best-written in any language;—while, on the
other hand, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[p. 119]</span>
book that overthrew this same Amadis, with all his chivalry, is the
“Don Quixote”; again, the oldest and best of all similar works, and
one that is still read and admired by thousands who know nothing of
the shadowy multitudes it destroyed, except what its great author
tells them. The “Conde Lucanor” appeared full half a century earlier
than the “Decamerone.” The “Diana” of Montemayor soon eclipsed its
Italian prototype in popularity, and, for a time, shone without a
successful rival of its class throughout Europe. The <i>picaresque</i>
stories, exclusively Spanish from the very first, and the multitudes
of tales that followed them with attributes hardly less separate and
national, never lose their Spanish air and costume, even in the most
successful of their foreign imitations. Taken together, the number
of these fictions is very great;—so great, that their mass may well
be called enormous. But what is more remarkable than their multitude
is the fact, that they were produced when the rest of Europe, with
a partial exception in favor of Italy, was not yet awakened to
corresponding efforts of the imagination; before Madame de Lafayette
had published her “Zayde”; before Sidney’s “Arcadia” had appeared, or
D’Urfé’s “Astrea,” or Corneille’s “Cid,” or Le Sage’s “Gil Blas.” In
short, they were at the height of their fame, just at the period when
the Hôtel de Rambouillet reigned supreme over the taste of France,
and when Hardy, following the indications of the public will and the
example of his rivals, could do no better than bring out upon the
stage of Paris nearly every one of the tales of Cervantes, and many of
those of Cervantes’s rivals and contemporaries.<a id="FNanchor_190"
href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a></p> <p><span
class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[p. 120]</span></p> <p>But civilization
and manners advanced in the rest of Europe rapidly from this moment,
and paused in Spain. Madrid, instead of sending its influences to
France, began itself to acknowledge the control of French literature
and refinement. The creative spirit, therefore, ceased in Spanish
romantic fiction, and, as we shall presently see, a spirit of French
imitation took its place.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> shall hardly look for forensic or
deliberative eloquence in Spain. The whole constitution of things
there, the political and ecclesiastical institutions of the country,
and, perhaps we should add, the very genius of the people, were
unfriendly to the growth of a plant like this, which flourishes only in
the soil of freedom.</p>

<p>The Spanish tribunals, in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries,
whether in the ordinary course of their administration of justice, or
in the dark proceedings of the Inquisition, took less cognizance of
the influences of eloquence than those of any other Christian country
of modern times. They dealt with the wheel and the fagot,—not with the
spirit of persuasion. Nor was this spirit truly known or favored in
the political assemblies of the kingdom, though it was not supplanted
there by the formidable instruments familiar in the courts of justice.
In the ancient Cortes of Castile, and still more in those of Aragon,
there may have been discussions which were raised by their fervor to
something like what we now call deliberative eloquence. We have, in
fact, intimations of such discussions in the old chronicles; especially
in those that record the trou<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[p.
122]</span>bles and violence of the great nobles in the reigns of John
the Second and Henry the Fourth. But a free, living debate on a great
political principle, or on the conduct of those who managed the affairs
of the country,—such a debate as sometimes shook the popular assemblies
of antiquity, and in modern times has often controlled the destinies of
Christendom,—was, in Spain, a thing absolutely unknown.</p>

<p>Even the grave and dry discussions, to which the pressure of
affairs gave rise, were rare and accidental. There was no training
for them; and they could be followed by none of the great practical
results that are at once the only sufficient motive and reward that
can make them enter freely into the institutions of a state. Indeed,
whatever there was of discussion in any open assembly could occur only
in the earlier period of the monarchy, when the language and culture
of the nation were still too little advanced to produce specimens of
careful debate; for from the time of Ferdinand and Isabella and the
days of the <i>Comunidades</i>, the Cortes were gradually restrained in
their privileges, until at last they ceased to be any thing but a part
of the pageantry of the empire, and served only to record the laws
they should themselves have discussed and modelled. From this period,
all opportunity for the growth of political eloquence in Spain was
lost. It would have been no more tolerated by one of the Philips than
Lutheranism.</p>

<p>The eloquence of the pulpit was checked by similar causes, but in
a different way. The Catholic religion has maintained in Spain, down
to a late period, more than it has in any other country, the character
it had during the Middle Ages. It has been to an extraordinary degree
a religion of mysteries, of forms, and of<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_123">[p. 123]</span> penance;—a religion, therefore, in which
such modes of moving the understanding and the heart as have prevailed
in France and England since the middle of the seventeenth century have
been rarely attempted, and never with great success.</p>

<p>If any exception is to be made to this remark, it must be made in
the case of Luis de Leon and in that of Luis de Granada. Of the first
we have already spoken. He printed, indeed, no sermons as such; but he
inserted in his other works, and especially in his “Names of Christ”
and in his “Perfect Wife,” long declamations, sometimes preceded by a
text and sometimes not, but regularly divided into heads, and wearing
the general appearance and attributes of religious discourses. These,
since they were printed as early as 1584, may be accounted the earliest
specimens of Spanish eloquence fitted for the pulpit, and, if not
actually delivered, are still worthy of notice.<a id="FNanchor_191"
href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a></p>

<p>The case of Luis de Granada is one more directly in point. That
remarkable man was head of the Dominican order, or the order of the
Preaching Monks, so that both his place and his profession led him to
the cultivation of the eloquence of the pulpit. But, besides this,
he seems to have devoted himself to it with the strong preference of
genius, preaching extemporaneously, it is said, with great power and
unction. In 1576, he published a Latin treatise on the subject of
Pulpit Eloquence; and in 1595, after his death, his friends printed, in
addition to those published during his lifetime, fourteen of his more
formal discourses, in which he has been thought, not only to have given
a full illustration<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[p. 124]</span>
of the precepts he inculcated, but to have placed himself at the head
of the department of eloquence to which he devoted so much of his
life.</p>

<p>They are in a bold and affluent style,—somewhat mystical, as were
his own religious tendencies,—and often more declamatory than seems in
keeping with the severe and solemn nature of their subjects; but they
are written with remarkable purity of idiom, and breathe everywhere
the spirit of the religion that was so deeply impressed on his age and
country. Perhaps a more characteristic specimen of Spanish eloquence
can hardly be found, than that in which Luis de Granada describes the
resurrection of the Saviour; adding to it his descent into hell to
rescue the souls of the righteous who were pining there because they
had died before his great sacrifice was completed,—a doctrine of the
Catholic Church capable of high poetical ornament, and one which,
from the time of Dante, has been often set forth with the most solemn
effect.</p>

<p>“On that glorious day,” exclaims Luis de Granada, in his sermon on
the Resurrection, “the sun shone more brightly than on all others,
serving its Lord in dutiful splendor amidst his rejoicings, as it had
served him in darkness through his sufferings. The heavens, which had
been veiled in mourning to hide his agonies, were now bright with
redoubled glory as they saw him rise conquering from the grave. And
who would not rejoice in such a day? The whole humanity of Christ
rejoiced in it; all the disciples of Christ rejoiced in it; heaven
rejoiced, earth rejoiced; hell itself shared in the general jubilee.
For the triumphant Prince descended into its depths, clothed with
splendor and might. The everlasting darkness grew bright before his
steps; the eternal lamentations ceased; the realms of torment<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[p. 125]</span> paused at his approach.
The princes of Edom were disturbed, and the mighty men of Moab
trembled, and they that dwelt in the land of Canaan were filled with
fear. And the multitude of the suffering murmured and said, ‘Who is
this mighty one, so resplendent, so powerful? Never before was his
likeness seen in these realms of hell; never hath the tributary world
sent such a one to these depths,—one who demands judgment, not a
debtor; one who fills us with dread, not one guilty like ourselves; a
judge, and not a culprit; a conqueror, not a sinner. Say, where were
our watchmen and our guards, when he burst in victory on our barred
gates? By what might has he entered? And who is he, that can do these
things? If he were guilty, he were not thus bold; if the shade of sin
lay on his soul, how could our darkness be made bright with his glory?
If he be God, why should hell receive him? and if he be man, whence
hath he this might? If he be God, why dwelt he in the grave? and if
man, by what authority would he thus lay waste our abodes?’</p>

<p>“Thus murmured the vassals of hell, as the Conqueror entered in
glory to free his chosen captives. For there stood they, all assembled
together,—all the souls of the just, who from the foundation of the
world till that day had passed through the gates of the grave; all the
prophets and men of might who had glorified the Lord in the manifold
agonies of martyrdom;—a glorious company!—a mighty treasure!—the
richest inheritance of Christ’s triumph! For there stood the two
original parents of the generations of mankind,—the first in sin and
the first in faith and hope. There stood that aged saint who rescued
in the ark of safety those that repeopled the world when the waters of
the deluge were spent. There stood the father of the faithful,<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[p. 126]</span> who first received by
merit the revelation of God’s will, and wore, in his person, the marks
of his election. There stood his obedient son, who, bearing on his
shoulders the wood of his own sacrifice, showed forth the redemption
of the world. There stood the holy progenitor of the Twelve Tribes,
who, winning his father’s blessing in the stranger guise of another’s
garb, set forth the mystery of the humanity and incarnation of the
Divine Word. There stood, also, as it were, guests newly arrived in
that strange land, the Holy Baptist and the blessed Simeon, who prayed
that he might not be taken from the earth till with his own eyes he
had seen its salvation; who received it in his arms, and sang gently
its canticle of peace. And there, too, found a place the poor Lazarus
of the Gospel, who, for the patience with which he bore his wounds,
deserved to join so noble a company, and share its longing hopes. And
all this multitude of sanctified spirits stood there mourning and
grieving for this day; and in the midst of them all, and as the leader
of them all, the holy king and prophet repeated without ceasing his
ancient lamentation: ‘As the hart panteth after the water-brooks, so
panteth my soul after thee, O God! My tears have been my meat day and
night, while they continually say unto me, Where is thy God?’ O blessed
and holy king, if this be the cause of thy lamentation, let it cease
for ever; for behold thy God! behold thy Saviour! Change, then, thy
chant, and sing as thou wast wont to sing of old: ‘Lord, thou hast
been favorable unto thy land; thou hast pardoned the offences of thy
people; thou hast hidden thy face from the multitude of their sins.’”<a
id="FNanchor_192" href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[p. 127]</span></p> <p>It
would not be easy to select a more striking example than this of the
peculiar rhetoric that was most sought in the Spanish pulpit. But the
portions of equal merit are few, and the amount of the whole is small.
After the beginning of the seventeenth century, the affected style of
Góngora and the conceits of the school of Ledesma found their way into
the churches generally, and especially into the churches of Madrid.
This was natural. No persons depended more on the voice of fashion
than the preachers of the court and the capital, and the fashion of
both was thoroughly infected with the new doctrines. Paravicino, at
this period, was at the head of the popular preachers; himself a poet
devoted to the affectations of Góngora; a man of wit, a gentleman, and
a courtier. From 1616 he was, during twenty years, pulpit orator to
Philip the Third and Philip the Fourth, and enjoyed, as such, a kind
and degree of popularity before unknown. As might have been expected,
he had many followers, each of whom sought to have a fashionable
audience. Such audiences were soon systematically provided. They were,
in fact, collected, arranged, and seated by the friends and admirers of
the preacher himself,—generally by those who, from their ecclesiastical
relations, had an interest in his success; and then the crowds thus
gathered were induced in different ways to express their approbation
of the more elaborate passages in his discourse. From this time, and
in this way, religious dignity disappeared from the Spanish pulpit,
and whatever there was of value in its eloquence was confined to two
forms,—the learned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[p. 128]</span>
discussions, often in Latin, addressed to bodies of ecclesiastics,
and the extemporaneous exhortations addressed to the lower
classes;—the latter popular and vehement in their tone, and, by their
coarseness, generally unworthy of the solemn subjects they touched.<a
id="FNanchor_193" href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a></p>


<p class="mt2">There is little in Spanish epistolary correspondence
that requires notice as a portion of the elegant literature of the
country. The heartiness of a simpler age gives, indeed, a charm to such
letters as those which claim to have been written by Cibdareal, and
in a less degree to those of Pulgar and Diego de Valera. Later, the
despatches of Columbus, in which he made known to the world his vast
discoveries, are occasionally marked by the fervor of an enthusiasm
inspired by his great subject; and those of his queen and patron,
though few in number and less interesting, are quite as characteristic
and quite as true-hearted.</p>

<p>But, with the stately court brought from the North by Charles
the Fifth, all this was changed. Added forms, and more than the old
national gravity, passed into the intercourse of social life, and
infected the style of the commonest correspondence. Genial familiarity
disappeared from the letters of friends, and even private affections
and feelings were either seldom expressed, or were so covered up as to
be with difficulty recognized.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[p.
129]</span> Thus, what was most valued in this department at the time,
and for a century afterwards, were Guevara’s “Golden Epistles,” which
are only formal dissertations, and the “Epistles” of Avila, which
are sermons in disguise, that moved the hearts of his countrymen
because they were such earnest exhortations to a religious life.<a
id="FNanchor_194" href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a></p>

<p>From these remarks, however, we should except portions of the
correspondence of Zurita, the historian, extending over the last thirty
years of his life, and ending in 1582, just before his death. They
give us the business-like intercourse of a man of letters, carried on
with all classes of society, from ministers of state and the highest
ecclesiastics of the realm down to persons distinguished only because
they were occupied in studies like his own. The number of letters in
this collection is large, amounting to above two hundred. More of them
are from Antonio Agustin, Archbishop of Tarragona, an eminent scholar
in Spanish history and civil law, than from any other person; but the
most interesting are from Zurita himself, from his friend Ambrosio
Morales, from Diego de Mendoza, the historian, Argote de Molina, the
antiquarian, and Fernan Nuñez, the Greek Commander. Each of these
series is marked by something characteristic of its author, and all
of them, taken together, show more familiarly the interior condition
of a scholar’s life in Spain, in the sixteenth century, than it can
be found anywhere else.<a id="FNanchor_195" href="#Footnote_195"
class="fnanchor">[195]</a></p> <p><span class="pagenum"
id="Page_130">[p. 130]</span></p> <p>But the principal exception to
be made in favor of Spanish epistolary correspondence is found in the
case of Antonio Perez, secretary of Philip the Second, and for some
time his favorite minister. His father, who was a scholar, and made a
translation of the “Odyssey,”<a id="FNanchor_196" href="#Footnote_196"
class="fnanchor">[196]</a> had been in the employment of Charles the
Fifth, so that the younger Perez inherited somewhat of the court
influence which was then so important; but his rapid advancement was
owing to his own genius, and to a love of intrigue and adventure, which
seemed to be a part of his nature. At last, in 1578, at the command of
his master, he not unwillingly brought about the murder of Escovedo,
a person high in the confidence of Don John of Austria, whose growing
influence it was thought worth while thus to curtail;—a crime which,
perpetrated as it was in consequence of the official connection of the
secretary with the monarch, brought Perez to the very height of his
favor.</p>

<p>But it was not long before the guilty agent became as unwelcome to
his guilty master as their victim had been. A change in their relations
followed, cautiously brought on by the unscrupulous king, but deep and
entire. At first, Philip permitted Perez to be pursued by the kinsmen
of the murdered man, and afterwards, contriving plausible pretexts for
hiding his motives, began himself to join in the persecution. Eleven
long years<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[p. 131]</span> the
wretched courtier was watched, vexed, and imprisoned, at Madrid; and
once, at least, he was subjected to cruel bodily tortures. When he
could endure this no longer, he fled to Aragon, his native kingdom,
whose freer political constitution did not permit him to be crushed
in secret. This was a great surprise to Philip, and, for an instant,
seems to have disconcerted his dark schemes. But his resources were
equal to the emergency. He pursued Perez to Saragossa, and finding
the regular means of justice unequal to the demands of his vengeance,
caused his victim to be seized by the Inquisition, under the absurd
charge of heresy. But this, again, in the form in which Philip found
it necessary to proceed, was a violation of the ancient privileges of
the kingdom, and the people broke out into open rebellion, and released
Perez from prison;—a consequence of his measures, which, perhaps, was
neither unforeseen by Philip nor unwelcome to him. At any rate, he
immediately sent an army into Aragon, sufficient, not only to overwhelm
all open resistance, but to strike a terror that should prevent
future opposition to his will; and the result, besides a vast number
of rich confiscations to the royal treasury, was the condemnation
of sixty-eight persons of distinction to death by the Inquisition,
and the final overthrow of nearly every thing that remained of the
long-cherished liberties of the country.</p>

<p>Meantime, Perez escaped secretly from Saragossa, as he had before
escaped from Madrid, and, wandering over the Pyrenees in the disguise
of a shepherd, sought refuge in Bearn, at the little court of Catherine
of Bourbon, sister of Henry the Fourth. Public policy caused him to
be well received both there and in France, where he afterwards passed
the greater part of his long exile. During the troubles between
Elizabeth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[p. 132]</span> and
Philip, he instinctively went to England, and, while there, was much
with Essex, and became more familiar with Bacon than the wise and pious
mother of the future chancellor thought it well one so profligate as
Perez should be. Philip, who could ill endure the idea of having such
a witness of his crimes intriguing at the courts of his great enemies,
endeavoured to have Perez assassinated both in Paris and London, and
failed more from accident than from want of well-concerted plans to
accomplish his object.</p>

<p>At last peace came between France and England on one side, and Spain
on the other; and Perez ceased to be a person of consequence to those
who had so long used him. Henry the Fourth, indeed, with his customary
good nature, still indulged him even in very extravagant modes of
life, which rather resembled those of a prince than of an exile. But
his claims were so unreasonable, and were urged with such boldness and
pertinacity, that every body wearied of him. He therefore fell into
unhonored poverty, and dragged out the miserable life of a neglected
courtier till 1611, when he died at Paris. Four years later, the
Inquisition, which had caused him to be burnt in effigy as a heretic,
reluctantly did him the imperfect justice of removing their anathemas
from his memory, and thus permitted his children to enter into civil
rights, of which nothing but the most shameless violence had ever
deprived them.</p>

<p>From the time of his first imprisonment, Perez began to write the
letters that are still extant; and their series never stops, till
we approach the period of his death. Some of them are to his wife
and children; others, to Gil de Mesa, his confidential friend and
agent; and others, to persons high in place, from whose influence he
hoped to gain favor. His Narratives, or “Re<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_133">[p. 133]</span>lations,” as he calls them, and his
“Memorial” on his own case, occasionally involve other letters, and are
themselves in the nature of long epistles, written with great talent
and still greater ingenuity, to gain the favor of his judges or of the
world. All these, some of which his position forbade him ever to send
to the persons to whom they were addressed, he carefully preserved,
and during his exile published them from time to time to suit his own
political purposes;—at first anonymously, or under the assumed name
of Raphael Peregrino; afterwards under the seeming editorship of his
friend Mesa; and finally, without disguise of any sort, dedicating some
of them to Henry the Fourth, and some to the Pope.</p>

<p>Their number is large, amounting in the most ample collection to
above a thousand pages. The best are those that are most familiar;
for even in the slightest of them, as when he is sending a present of
gloves to Lady Rich, or a few new-fashioned toothpicks to the Duke of
Mayenne, there is a nice preservation of the Castilian proprieties
of expression. Many of them sparkle with genius; sometimes most
unexpectedly, though not always in good taste; Thus, to his innocent
wife, shamefully kept in prison during his exile, he says: “Though
you are not allowed to write to me, or to enjoy what to the absent
is the breath of life; yet here [in France] there is no punishment
for the promptings of natural affection. I answer, therefore, what
I hear in the spirit, your complaints of the punishment laid on
your own virtues and on the innocence of your children,—complaints,
which reach me from that asylum of darkness and of the shadow of
death, in which you now lie. But when I listen, it seems as if I
ought to hear you no less with my outward ears, just as the<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[p. 134]</span> words and cries that come
from the caves under the earth only resound the louder, as they are
rolled up to us from their dark hiding-places.”<a id="FNanchor_197"
href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> And again, when
speaking of the cruel conduct of his judges to his family, he breaks
out: “But let them not be deceived. Their victims may be imprisoned and
loaded with irons; but they have the two mightiest advocates of the
earth to defend them,—their innocence and their wrongs. For neither
could Cicero nor Demosthenes so pierce the ears of men, nor so stir
up their minds, nor so shake the frame of things, as can these two,
to whom God has given the especial privilege to stand for ever in his
presence, to cry for justice, and to be witnesses and advocates for one
another in whatsoever he has reserved for his own awful judgment.”<a
id="FNanchor_198" href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a></p>

<p>The letters of Perez are in a great variety of styles, from
the cautious and yet fervent appeals that he made to Philip the
Second, down to the gallant notes he wrote to court ladies, and the
overflowings of his heart to his young children. But they are all
written in remarkably idiomatic Castilian, and are rendered interesting
from the circumstance, that in each class there is a strict observance
of such conventional forms as were required by the relative social
positions of the author and his correspondents.<a id="FNanchor_199"
href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a></p> <p><span
class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[p. 135]</span></p> <p>The letters of
Santa Teresa, who was a contemporary of the secretary of Philip the
Second, and died in 1582, are entirely different; for while nothing can
be more practical and worldly than those of Perez, the letters of the
devout nun are entirely spiritual. She believed herself to be inspired,
and therefore wrote with an air of authority, which is almost always
solemn and imposing, but which sometimes, through its very boldness and
freedom from all restraint, becomes easy and graceful. Her talents were
versatile and her perceptions acute. To each of her many correspondents
she says something that seems suited to the occasion on which she is
consulted;—a task not easy for a nun, who lived forty-seven years in
retirement from the world, and during that time was called upon to give
advice to archbishops and bishops, to wise and able statesmen like
Diego de Mendoza, to men of genius like Luis de Granada, to persons in
private life who were in deep affliction or in great danger, and to
women in the ordinary course of their daily lives. Her letters fill
four volumes, and though, in general, they are only to be regarded
as fervent exhortations or religious teachings, still, by the<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[p. 136]</span> purity, beauty, and
womanly grace of their style, they may fairly claim a distinguished
place in the epistolary literature of her country.<a id="FNanchor_200"
href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a></p>

<p>Some portions of the correspondence of Bartolomé de Argensola about
1625, of Lope de Vega before 1630, and of Quevedo a little later, have
been preserved to us; but they are too inconsiderable in amount to have
much value. Of Cascales, the rhetorician, we have more. In 1634, he
printed three Decades of Letters; but they are almost entirely devoted
to discussions of points that involve learned lore; and, even where
they are not such, they are stiff and formal. A few by Nicolas Antonio,
the literary historian, who died in 1684, are plain and business-like,
but are written in a hard style, that prevents them from being
interesting. Those of Solís, who closes up the century and the period,
are better. They are such as belong to the intercourse of an old man,
left to struggle through the last years of a long life with poverty and
misfortune, and express the feelings becoming his situation, both with
philosophical calmness and Christian resignation.<a id="FNanchor_201"
href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a></p> <p><span
class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[p. 137]</span></p> <p>But no writer in
the history of Spanish epistolary correspondence can be compared for
acuteness and brilliancy with Antonio Perez, or for eloquence with
Santa Teresa.</p>

  — Zurita, Morales, Ribadeneyra, Siguenza, Mariana, Sandoval,
  Herrera, Argensola, the Inca Garcilasso, Mendoza, Moncada,
  Coloma, Melo, Saavedra, Solís. — General Remarks on the Spanish
  Historians.</span></p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> fathers of Spanish history, as
distinguished from Spanish chronicling, are Zurita and Morales, both of
whom, educated in the reign of Charles the Fifth, show that they were
not insensible to the influences of that great period in the annals
of their country, and both of whom, after its close, prepared and
published their works under the happiest auspices.</p>

<p>Zurita was born in Saragossa in 1512, and died there in 1580; so
that he had the happiness to live while the political privileges of
his native kingdom were yet little impaired, and to die just before
they were effectually broken down. His father was a favored physician
of Ferdinand the Catholic, and accompanied that monarch to Naples in
1506. The son, who showed from early youth a great facility in the
acquisition of knowledge, was educated at the University of Alcalá,
where it was his good fortune to have, for his chief instructor,
Fernan Nuñez, who was commonly called the Greek Commander, from the
circumstance, that, while his position in the state as a member of the
great family of the Guzmans made him Knight Commander of the Order
of Santiago, his personal acquisitions and<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_139">[p. 139]</span> talents rendered him the first Greek
scholar of his age and country.</p>

<p>As the elder Zurita continued to be much trusted by Charles
the Fifth, and as his son’s connections were chiefly with persons
of great consideration, the progress of the future historian was,
at first, rather in the direction of public affairs. But in 1548,
under circumstances peculiarly honorable to him, he was appointed
historiographer of Aragon; being elected unanimously by the free Cortes
of the kingdom to the office, which they had just established, and as a
candidate for which he had to encounter the most powerful and learned
competitors. The election seems to have satisfied his ambition, and to
have given a new direction to his life. At any rate, he immediately
procured a royal warrant to examine and use all documents needful for
his purpose that could be found in any part of the empire. Under this
broad authority he went over much of Spain, consulting and arranging
the great national records at Simancas, and then visited Sicily and
Naples, from whose monasteries and public archives he obtained further
ample and learned spoils.</p>

<p>The result was, that between 1562 and 1580 he published, in six
folio volumes, “The Annals of Aragon,” from the invasion of the country
by the Arabs to 1516, the last third of his labor being entirely given
to the reign of Ferdinand the Catholic, for which the recollections of
his father’s life at the court of that monarch probably afforded some
of the more interesting materials. The whole work is more important
for Spanish history than any that had preceded it. It has hardly any
thing of the monkish credulity of the old chronicles, for Zurita was
a man of the world, and always concerned in the stirring interests of
his time; first, from having<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[p.
140]</span> been intrusted with the municipal affairs of one of the
principal cities of the kingdom; next, from being charged with the
general correspondence of the Inquisition; and finally, from his
duties as one of the secretaries of Philip the Second, which kept
him much at court and about the king’s person. It shows, too, not
unfrequently, a love for the ancient privileges of Aragon, and a
generosity of opinion on political subjects, remarkable in one who
was aware that whatever he wrote would not only be submitted before
its publication to the censorship of jealous rivals, but read by the
wary and severe monarch on whom all his fortunes depended. Its faults
are its great length and a carelessness of style, scarcely regarded
as faults at the time when it was written.<a id="FNanchor_202"
href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a></p> <p><span
class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[p. 141]</span></p> <p>Morales, who was
an admirer of Zurita, and defended him from one of his assailants in
a tract published at the end of the last volume of the “Annals of
Aragon,” was born in 1513, a year after his friend, and died in 1591,
having survived him by eleven years. He was educated at Salamanca,
and, besides early obtaining Church preferments and distinctions, rose
subsequently to eminence as a Professor in the University of Alcalá.
But from 1570, when he was appointed historiographer to the crown of
Castile, he devoted himself to the completion of the History begun on
so vast a scale by Ocampo, whose work he seems to have taken up in some
degree out of regard for the memory of its author.</p>

<p>He began his task, however, too late. He was already sixty-seven
years old, and when he died, eleven years afterwards, he had been
able to bring it down no further than to the union of the crowns
of Castile and Leon, in 1037,—a point from which it was afterwards
carried, by Sandoval, to the death of Alfonso the Seventh, in 1097,
where it finally stops. Imperfect, however, as is the portion compiled
in his old age by Morales, we can hardly fail to regard it, not,
indeed, as so wise and well-weighed an historical composition as that
of Zurita, but as one marked with much more general ability, and
showing a much more enlightened spirit, than the work of Ocampo, to
which it serves as a continuation. Its style, unhappily, is wanting
in correctness;—a circumstance the more to be noticed, since Morales
valued himself on his pure Castilian, both as the son of a gentleman
of high caste, and as the nephew of Fernan de Oliva, by whom he was
educated, and whose works he had published because they had done
so much to advance prose composition in Spain.<a id="FNanchor_203"
href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a></p> <p><span
class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[p. 142]</span></p> <p>Contemporary with
both Zurita and Morales, but far in advance of both of them as a writer
of history, was the old statesman, Diego de Mendoza, whose fresh and
vigorous account of the rebellion of the Moors in 1568 we have already
considered, noticing it rather at the period when it was written than
at the beginning of the seventeenth century, when it was first given
to the world, and when Siguenza, Ribadeneyra, Mariana, Sandoval, and
Herrera had already appeared, and determined the character which should
be finally impressed on this department of Spanish literature.</p>

<p>Of this group, the first two, who devoted themselves to
ecclesiastical history, and entered into the religious discussions of
their time, were, perhaps, originally the most prominent. Ribadeneyra,
one of the early and efficient members of the Society of Jesuits,
distinguished himself by his “History of the Schism in the English
Church,” in the time of Henry the Eighth, and by his “Lives of the
Saints.” Siguenza, who was a disciple of Saint Jerome, was no less
faithful to the brotherhood<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[p.
143]</span> by whom he was adopted and honored, as his life of
their founder and his history of their Order abundantly prove.
Both were men of uncommon gifts, and wrote with a manly and noble
eloquence; the first with more richness and fervor, the last with a
more simple dignity, but each with the earnest and trusting spirit
of his peculiar faith.<a id="FNanchor_204" href="#Footnote_204"
class="fnanchor">[204]</a></p>

<p>From the nature of their subjects, however, neither of them rose to
be the great historian of his country;—an honor which belongs to Juan
de Mariana, a foundling, who was born at Talavera in 1536, and whose
extraordinary talents attracted the attention of the Jesuits, then
fast advancing into notice as a religious power. Having gone through
a severe course of studies at Alcalá, he was selected, at the age of
twenty-four, to fill the most important place in the great college
which the members of his society were then establishing at Rome,
and which they regarded as one of their principal institutions for
consolidating and extending their influence. After five years, he was
removed to Sicily,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[p. 144]</span>
to introduce similar studies into that island; and, a little later,
he was transferred to Paris, where he was received with honor, and
taught for several years, lecturing chiefly on the works and opinions
of Thomas Aquinas, to crowded audiences. But the climate of France was
unfriendly to his health, and in 1574, having spent thirteen years
in foreign countries, as a public instructor, he returned to Spain,
and established himself in the house of his order at Toledo, which he
hardly left during the forty-nine remaining years of his life.</p>

<p>This long period, which he devoted to literary labor, was not,
however, permitted to be as peaceful as his merits should have
made it. The Polyglot Bible published by Arias Montano at Antwerp,
in 1569-72,—which was at first received with great favor, but
afterwards, by the intrigues of the Jesuits, was denounced to the
Inquisition,—excited so bitter a quarrel, that it was deemed necessary
to inquire into the truth of the charges brought against it. By the
management of the Jesuits, Mariana was the principal person employed to
make the investigation; and, through his learning and influence, they
felt sure of a triumph. But though he was a faithful Jesuit, he was
not a subservient one. His decision was in favor of Montano; and this,
together with the circumstance that he did not follow the intimations
given to him when he was employed in arranging the Index Expurgatorius
of 1584, brought upon him the displeasure of his superiors in a way
that caused him much trouble.<a id="FNanchor_205" href="#Footnote_205"
class="fnanchor">[205]</a></p>

<p>In 1599, he published a Latin treatise on the Institu<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[p. 145]</span>tion of Royalty, and
dedicated it to Philip the Third;—a work liberal in its general
political tone, and even intimating that there are cases in which it
may be lawful to put a monarch to death. At home, it caused little
remark. It was regularly approved by the censors of the press, and
is even said to have been favored by the policy of the government,
which, in the time of Philip the Second, had sent assassins to cut off
Elizabeth of England and the Prince of Orange. But in France, where
Henry the Third had been thus put to death a few years before, and
where Henry the Fourth suffered a similar fate a few years afterwards,
it excited a great sensation. Indeed, the sixth chapter of the first
book directly mentions, and by implication countenances, the murder
of the former of these monarchs, and was claimed, though contrary
to the truth of fact, to have been among the causes that stimulated
Ravaillac to the assassination of the latter. It was, therefore,
both attacked and defended with extraordinary acrimony; and at last
the Parliament of Paris ordered it to be burned by the hands of the
common hangman. What was more unfortunate for its author, the whole
discussion having brought much popular odium on the Jesuits, who were
held responsible for a book which was written by one of their order,
and could not have been published without permission of its heads,
Mariana himself became more than ever unwelcome to the great body of
his religious associates.<a id="FNanchor_206" href="#Footnote_206"
class="fnanchor">[206]</a></p> <p><span class="pagenum"
id="Page_146">[p. 146]</span></p> <p>At last, an occasion was found
where he could be assailed without assigning the reasons for the
attack. In 1609, he published, not in Spain, but at Cologne, seven
Latin treatises on various subjects of theology and criticism, such
as the state of the Spanish theatre, the Arab computation of time,
and the year and day of the Saviour’s birth. Most of them were of a
nature that could provoke no animadversion; but one, “On Mortality and
Immortality,” was seized upon for theological censure, and another, “On
the Coinage of the Realm,” was assailed on political grounds, because
it showed how unwise and scandalous had been the practices of the
reigning favorite, the Duke of Lerma, in tampering with the currency
and debasing it. The Inquisition took cognizance of both; and their
author, though then seventy-three years old, was subjected first to
confinement, and afterwards to penance, for his offences. Both works
were placed at once on the Index Expurgatorius; and Philip the Third
gave orders to collect and destroy as many copies as possible of the
volume in which they were contained. As Lope de Vega said, “His country
did not pardon the most learned Mariana when he erred.”</p>

<p>His treatment on this occasion was undoubtedly the more severe,
because among his papers was found a treatise “On the Errors in the
Government of the Society of Jesuits,” which was not printed till after
its author’s death, and then with no friendly views to the order.<a
id="FNanchor_207" href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a>
But the firm spirit of Mariana was not broken<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_147">[p. 147]</span> by his persecutions. He went forward with
his literary labors to the last; and when he died, in 1623, it was of
the infirmities which his extreme age had naturally brought with it. He
was eighty-seven years old.</p>

<p>The main occupation of the last thirty or forty years of his life
was his great History. In the foreign countries where he had long
lived, the earlier annals of Spain were so little known to the learned
men with whom he had been associated, that, as a Spaniard, he had felt
mortified by an ignorance which seemed disrespectful to his country. He
determined, therefore, to do something that should show the world by
what manly steps Spain had come into the larger interests of Europe,
and to prove by her history that she deserved the consideration she
had, from the time of Charles the Fifth, everywhere enjoyed. He began
his work, therefore, in Latin, that all Christendom might be able to
read it, and in 1592 published, in that language, twenty out of thirty
of the books, of which it consists.</p>

<p>But, even before he had printed the other ten books, which appeared
in 1609, he was fortunately induced, like Cardinal Bembo, to become
his own translator, and to give his work to his countrymen in the pure
Castilian of Toledo. In doing this, he enjoyed a great advantage.<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[p. 148]</span> He might use a freedom
in his version that could be claimed by no one else; for he had not
only a right to change the phraseology and arrangement, but, whenever
he saw fit, he might modify the opinions of a book which was as much
his own in the one language as in the other. His “Historia de España,”
therefore, the first part of which appeared in 1601, has all the air
and merit of an original work; and in the successive editions published
under his own direction, and especially in the fourth, which appeared
the very year of his death, it was gradually enlarged, enriched, and
in every way improved, until it became, what it has remained ever
since, the proudest monument erected to the history of his country.<a
id="FNanchor_208" href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a></p>

<p>It begins with the supposed peopling of Spain by Tubal, the son of
Japhet, and comes down to the death of Ferdinand the Catholic and the
accession of Charles the Fifth; to all which Mariana himself afterwards
added a compressed abstract of the course of events to 1621, when
Philip the Fourth ascended the throne. It was a bold undertaking,
and in some respects is marked with the peculiar spirit of its age.
In weighing the value of authorities, for instance, he has been less
careful than became the high office he had assumed. He follows Ocampo,
and especially Garibay,—credulous compilers of old fables, who were
his own contemporaries,—confessing freely that he thought it safest
and best to take the received traditions of the country, unless
obvious reasons called upon him to reject them.<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_149">[p. 149]</span> His manner, too, is, in a few
particulars, open to remark. In the beautiful dedication of the Spanish
version of his History to Philip the Third, he admits that antiquated
words occasionally adhere to his style, from his familiar study of the
old writers; and Saavedra, who was pleased to find fault with him,
says, that, as other people dye their beards to make themselves look
young, Mariana dyed his to make himself look old.<a id="FNanchor_209"
href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a></p>

<p>But there is another side to all this. His willing belief in the
old chronicles, tempered, as it necessarily is, by his great learning,
gives an air of true-heartedness and good faith to his accounts, and a
picturesqueness to his details, which are singularly attractive; while,
at the same time, his occasional antiquated words and phrases, so well
suited to such views of his subject, add to the idiomatic richness, in
which, among Spanish prose compositions, the style of Mariana is all
but unrivalled. His narratives—the most important part of an historical
work of this class—are peculiarly flowing, free, and impressive. The
accounts of the wars of Hannibal, in the second book; those of the
irruption of the Northern nations, with which the fifth opens; the
conspiracy of John de Procida, in the fourteenth; the last scenes in
the troubled life of Peter the Cruel, in the seventeenth; and most of
the descriptions of the leading events in the reign of Ferdinand and
Isabella,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[p. 150]</span> towards
the conclusion of the work, give abundant proof of this peculiar
historical talent. They seem instinct with life and movement.</p>

<p>His formal speeches, in which he made Livy his model, are,
generally, less fortunate. Most of them want individuality and
appropriateness. But the one which in the fifth book he has given to
Ruy Lope Davalos, when that nobleman offers the crown of Castile to
the Infante Don Ferdinand, is remarkable for the courageous spirit in
which it discusses the foundations of all political government, and
leaves the rights of kings to rest on the assent of their subjects;—a
boldness, it should be added, which is apparent in many other parts of
his history, as it was in much of his life.</p>

<p>The characters he has drawn of the prominent personages that, from
time to time, come to the front of the stage, are almost always short,
sketched with a few touches, and struck off with the hand of a master.
Such are those of Alvaro de Luna, Alfonso the Wise, and the unhappy
Prince of Viana, in which so few words could hardly be made to express
more.</p>

<p>As a general remark, a certain nobleness of air and carriage,
not, perhaps, without something of the old Castilian sturdiness,
but never without its dignity, is the characteristic that most
prevails throughout the whole work; and this, with its admirably
idiomatic style,—so full, yet so unencumbered, so pure and yet
so rich,—renders it, if not the most trustworthy of annals, at
least the most remarkable union of picturesque chronicling with
sober history, that the world has ever seen.<a id="FNanchor_210"
href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a></p> <p><span
class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[p. 151]</span></p> <p>Sandoval, who
was one of the salaried chroniclers of the monarchy, and who, in that
capacity, prepared the continuation of Morales, already noticed, seems
to have been willing to constitute himself the successor of Mariana,
and prosecute the general history of Spain where that eloquent Jesuit
was likely to leave it, rather than from the point where he had
himself officially taken it up. At least he began there, and wrote an
elaborate life of Charles the Fifth. But it is too long. It fills as
many pages as the entire work of Mariana, and, though written with
simplicity, is not attractive in its style. His prejudices are strong
and obvious. Not only the monk,—for he was a Benedictine, and enjoyed
successively two very rich bishoprics,—but the courtier of Philip the
Third, is constantly apparent. He lays the whole crime of the assault
and capture of Rome upon the Constable de Bourbon; and, besides
tracing the Austrian family distinctly to Adam, he connects its honors
genealogically with those of Hercules and Dardanus. Still, the History
of Sandoval is a documentary work of authority much relied on by
Robertson, and one that, on the whole, by its ample and minute details,
gives a more satisfactory account of the reign of Charles the Fifth
than any other single history extant. It was first published in 1604-6,
and its author died at the end of 1620 or the beginning of 1621.<a
id="FNanchor_211" href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[p. 152]</span></p>
<p>After this, no important and connected work on the history of
Spain, that falls within the domain of elegant literature, appeared
for a long period.<a id="FNanchor_212" href="#Footnote_212"
class="fnanchor">[212]</a> Portions of<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_153">[p. 153]</span> Spanish history, and portions of the
history of Spanish discovery and conquest in the East and the West,
were indeed published from time to time, but the official chroniclers
of the crowns of Castile and Aragon no longer felt themselves bound
to go on with the great works of their predecessors, and the decaying
spirit of the monarchy made no earnest demands on others to tread in
their steps. Some, however, of these historians of the outposts of an
empire which now extended round the globe, and some of the accounts of
isolated events in its annals at home, should be noticed.</p>

<p>Of this class, the first in importance and the most comprehensive
in character is “The General History of the Indies,” by Antonio de
Herrera. It embraces the period from the first discovery of America to
the year 1554; and as Herrera was a practised writer, and, from his
official position as historiographer to the Indies, had access to every
source of information known in his time, his work, which was printed
in 1601, is of great value. But he was the author of other historical
works, for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[p. 154]</span> which
his qualifications and resources were less satisfactory and his
prejudices more abundant;—such as a “History of the World during the
Reign of Philip the Second,” a History of the affairs of England and
Scotland, during the unhappy times of Mary Stuart; a History of the
League in France; and a History of the affair of Antonio Perez and
the troubles that followed it;—all written under the influence of
contemporary passions, and all published between 1589 and 1612, before
any of these passions had been much tranquillized.</p>

<p>It is sufficient to say of them, that, in the case of Antonio Perez,
Herrera suppresses nearly every one of the important facts that tend
to the justification of that remarkable man; and that, by way of a
glorious termination to his Universal History, he gives Philip the
Second, in his death-struggles, miraculous assistance from heaven,
to enable him to end his long and holy life by an act of devotion.
Herrera’s chief reputation, therefore, as an historian, must rest upon
his great work on the Discovery and Conquest of America, in which,
indeed, his style, nowhere rich or powerful, seems better and more
effective than it is in his other attempts at historical composition.
He died in 1625, above seventy-six years old, much valued by Philip
the Fourth, as he had been by that monarch’s father and grandfather.<a

<p>But the East, as well as the West, was now opened to Spanish
adventure. The conquest of Portugal had<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_155">[p. 155]</span> brought the Oriental dependencies of that
kingdom under the authority of the Spanish crown; and as the Count
de Lemos, the great patron of letters in his time, and President of
the Council of the Indies, chanced to have his attention particularly
drawn in that direction, he commanded the younger of the Argensolas to
write an account of the Moluccas. The poet obeyed, and published his
work in 1609, dedicating it to Philip the Third. It is one of the most
pleasing of the minor Spanish histories; full of the traditions found
among the natives by the Portuguese, when they first landed, and of the
wild adventures that followed when they had taken possession of the
islands. Parts of it are, indeed, inconsistent with the nature of the
civilization they found there, such as formal and eloquent harangues
attributed to the natives; while other parts, like some of its
love-stories, are romantic enough to be suspected of invention, even
if they are true. But, in general, the work is written in an agreeable
poetical style, such as is not unbefitting an account of the mysterious
isles</p>

<p>Quite as uncertain in authority and less elegant in style are the
histories of Garcilasso de la Vega,—a gentle and trusting spirit
rather than a wise one; proud<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[p.
156]</span> of being a captain in the service of the king of Spain, and
allied, as a son of one of the unscrupulous conquerors of Peru, to the
great house of Infantado; but always betraying the weaker nature of his
mother, who was of the blood royal of the Incas, and never entirely
forgetting the glories of his Indian race, or the cruel injuries they
had suffered at the hands of Spain. He was born at “Cuzco, in Peru,
the seat of Atabalipa,” in 1540, and was educated there, amidst the
tumults of the conquest; but, when he was twenty years old, he was
sent to Spain, where, under difficult and trying circumstances, he
maintained an honorable reputation during a life protracted to the age
of seventy-six.</p>

<p>The military part of his personal history, which consisted of
service under Don John of Austria against the Moriscos of Granada,
was not of much consequence, though he seems to have valued himself
upon it not a little. The part he gave to letters was more interesting
and important. This portion he began, in 1590, with a translation
of the “Dialogues on Love,” by Abarbanel, a Platonizing Jew, whose
family had been expelled from Spain in the persecution under
Ferdinand and Isabella, and who in Italy had published this singular
work under the name of “The Hebrew Lion.” The attempt, so far as
Garcilasso was concerned, was not a fortunate one. The Dialogues,
which enjoyed considerable popularity at the time, had been already
printed in Spanish,—a fact evidently unknown to him; and though, as
it appears from a subsequent statement by himself, he had obtained
for his translation the favorable regard of Philip the Second, still
there was an odor both of Judaism and heathen free-thinking about
it, that rendered it obnoxious to the ecclesiastical authorities
of the state. Garcilasso’s first work, therefore, was speedily
placed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[p. 157]</span> on the Index
Expurgatorius, and was rarely heard of afterwards.</p>

<p>His next attempt was on a subject in which he had a nearer interest.
It was a “History of Florida,” or rather of the first discovery of that
country, and was published in 1605,—a work which, when, twenty years
before, he spoke of writing it, he appropriately called “The Expedition
of Fernando de Soto”; since the adventures of that extraordinary man,
and his strange fate, not only form its most brilliant and attractive
portion, but constitute nearly the whole of its substance. In this
Garcilasso was more successful than he was in his version from the
Italian; and his “History of Florida,” as it is still called, has been
often reprinted since.</p>

<p>But, in his old age, his heart turned more and more to the thoughts
and feelings of his youth, and, gathering together the few materials
he could collect from among his kinsmen on the Pacific, as well as
from the stores of his own memory and the records already accumulated
in Spain, he published, in 1609, the first part of his “Commentaries
on Peru”; the second of which, though licensed for the press in
1613, did not appear till 1617, the year after its author’s death.
It is a garrulous, gossiping book, written in a diffuse style, and
abounding in matters personal to himself. In its very division, he
acknowledges frankly the conflicting claims that he felt were upon
him. The earlier half, he says, relates to the eighteen Incas known
to Peruvian history, and contains an account of the traditions of the
country, its institutions, manners, and general character; all which he
offers as a tribute due to his descent from the Children of the Sun.
The remainder—which, with many episodes and much irrelevant, but not
always unpleasant, discussion, contains the history of the Span<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[p. 158]</span>ish conquest, and of the
quarrels of the Spaniards with each other growing out of it—he offers,
in like manner, to the glories of the great Spanish family with which
he was connected, and which numbered on its rolls some of the brightest
names in the Castilian annals. In both parts, his Commentaries are a
striking and interesting book, showing much of the spirit of the old
chronicles, and infected with even more than the common measure of
chronicling credulity; since, with a natural willingness to believe
whatever fables were honorable to the land of his birth, he mingles
a constant anxiety to show that he is, above every thing else, a
Catholic Christian, whose faith was much too ample to reject the
most extravagant legends of his Church, and too pure to tolerate the
idolatry of that royal ancestry which he yet cannot help regarding with
reverence and admiration.<a id="FNanchor_215" href="#Footnote_215"
class="fnanchor">[215]</a></p>

<p>The publication, in 1610, of “The War of Granada,” by Mendoza,
had—as might have been anticipated from its attractive subject and
style—an effect on Spanish historical composition; producing, in the
course of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[p. 159]</span>
century, several imitations more worthy of notice than any thing in
their class that appeared after the great work of Mariana.</p>

<p>The first of them is by Moncada, a nobleman of the highest rank
in the South of Spain, and connected with several of the principal
families, both in Catalonia and Valencia. His father was, successively,
viceroy of Sardinia and Aragon; he himself was governor of the Low
Countries and commander-in-chief of the armies there; and both of them
filled, in their respective times, the most important of the Spanish
embassies. But the younger Moncada had tastes widely different from
the cares that beset his life. In 1623 he published his “Expedition
of the Catalans against the Turks and Greeks”; and when he died,
in 1635, just after putting to rout two hostile armies, he left
several other works, of less value, one or two of which have since
been printed. The History of the Catalan Expedition, by which alone
he has been known in later times, is on the romantic adventures and
achievements of an extraordinary band of mercenaries, who, under Roger
de Flor,—successively a freebooter, a great admiral, and a Cæsar of the
Eastern Empire,—drove back the Turks, as they approached the Bosphorus
in the beginning of the fourteenth century, and then, after being for
some time no less formidable to their allies than they had been to the
infidel, settled down into a sort of uneasy tranquillity at Athens,
where their historian leaves them.</p>

<p>It is an account, therefore, of a most wild passage in the affairs
rather of the Middle Ages than of the Spanish peninsula,—one that may
be trusted, notwithstanding its air of romance, since its foundations
are laid in the great work of Zurita, and one by no means wanting
in picturesque effect, since its details are often taken<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[p. 160]</span> from Ramon Muntaner, the
old Catalan, who had himself shared the perils of this very expedition,
and described them in his own Chronicle with his accustomed spirit and
vigor. Parts of it are very striking in themselves, and strikingly
told; especially the rise of Roger de Flor till he had reached the
highest place a subject could hold in the Greek empire, and then his
assassination in the presence and by the command of the same Emperor
who had raised him so high,—his blood soiling the imperial table, to
which, with treacherous hospitality, he had been invited. The whole is
written in a bold and free, rather than in a careful style; but the
coloring is well suited to the dark ground-work of the picture, and,
though less energetic in its tone than Mendoza’s “War of Granada,”
of which, from the first sentence, we see it is an imitation, it
is often more easy, flowing, and natural.<a id="FNanchor_216"
href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a></p>

<p>Another military history written by a nobleman connected with the
service of his country, both in its armies and its diplomacy, is to
be found in an account of eleven campaigns in Flanders by Coloma,
Marquis of Espinar, published in 1625. A translation which he made of
the “Annals” of Tacitus has been regarded as the best in the language;
but, in his own work, he shows no tendency to imitate the ancients. On
the contrary, it is, as it were, fresh from the fields of the author’s
glory, and full of the honorable feelings of a soldier, sketching
the adventures of the army when in camp, when in immediate action,
and when in winter-quarters; and adding to<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_161">[p. 161]</span> his main narrative occasional glimpses
of the negotiations then going on in the Low Countries respecting
Spanish affairs, and of the intrigues of the courtiers at Madrid round
the death-bed of Philip the Second. The style of Coloma is unequal;
but much of what he describes he had seen, and the rest had passed
within the compass of what he deemed sure information; so that he
speaks, not only with authority, but with the natural vivacity which
comes from being so near the events he records, that their color is
imparted to his language.<a id="FNanchor_217" href="#Footnote_217"
class="fnanchor">[217]</a></p>

<p>To the same class with the last belongs the spirited history of a
portion of the Catalan rebellion in the time of Philip the Fourth. It
was written by Melo, a Portuguese gentleman, who remained attached to
the service of Spain till 1640-41, when he joined the standard of the
Braganzas, and fought for the independence of his own country. His
life, which extended from 1611 to 1667, was full of adventure. He was
in the dreadful tempest of 1627, when the whole navy, as it were, of
Portugal suffered shipwreck; and it fell to his lot to bury above two
thousand bodies of those who had perished in the waves, from which
he himself had hardly escaped. He was in the wars of Flanders and of
Catalonia. Twelve years he was in prison in his own country, under an
accusation of murder that was at last proved to be without foundation;
and six years he was an exile in Brazil. But under all circumstances,
and through all his trials, he sought consolation in letters. His
published works, in prose and verse, in Spanish and in Portuguese, some
of which have been already noticed, exceed a hundred volumes, and the
unpublished<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[p. 162]</span> would
materially increase even this vast amount. What is more remarkable, he
is, in both languages, admitted to the honors of a classic writer.</p>

<p>His “History of the War of Catalonia,” which embraces only the
short period during which he served in it, was written while he was in
prison, and was first published in 1645. Owing to political causes,
he did not give his name to it; and when one of his friends in a
letter expressed surprise at this circumstance, he answered, with a
characteristic turn of phrase, “The book loses nothing for want of my
name, and I shall lose nothing for want of the book.” It was, however,
successful. The accounts of the first outbreak in Barcelona, on the
feast of Corpus Christi, when the city was thronged with the bold
peasantry of the interior; the subsequent strife of the exasperated
factions; the debates in the Junta of Catalonia, and those in the
king’s council, under the leading of the Count Duke Olivares; and the
closing scene of the whole,—the ineffectual storming of the grand
fortress of Mon Juich by the royal forces, and the disastrous retreat
that followed,—are all given with a freshness and power that could
come only from one who had shared in the feelings he describes, and
had witnessed the very movements he sets with such a lifelike spirit
before us. His style, too, is suited to his varying subjects; sometimes
animated and forcible, sometimes quaint and idiomatic, and sometimes in
its dark hints and abrupt turns reminding us of Tacitus. But the work
is short,—not longer than that of Mendoza, which was its model,—and it
covers only the space of about six months at the end of 1640 and the
beginning of 1641.</p>

<p>Whether Melo intended to carry his narrative farther is uncertain.
From his striking conclusion, where he<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_163">[p. 163]</span> says, “The events that followed—greater
in themselves than those I have related—are perhaps reserved for a
greater historian,” we might infer that he was desirous to describe
only what he had witnessed. But, on the other side, in his Preface we
have the following characteristic address to his readers, alluding to
the concealment of his name as the author of the work he offers them.
“If in any thing I have served you, I ask only that you would not
endeavour to know more of me than it pleases my humor to tell you. I
present to you my faithful opinion of things, just as it has been my
lot to form it;—I do not present myself to you; for a knowledge of
my person is not necessary to enable you to judge either kindly or
harshly of what I have written. If I do not please you, read me no
further;—if I do, I make no claims on your gratitude. I speak without
fear and without vanity. The theatre before us is vast; the tragedy
long. We shall meet again. You will know me by my voice; I shall know
you by your judgment.” But, whatever may have been Melo’s original
intentions, he survived the publication of this interesting work above
twenty years, and yet added nothing to its pages.<a id="FNanchor_218"
href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a></p>

<p>From this period, prose composition, which had been long infected
with the bad taste of the age, suffered a<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_164">[p. 164]</span> still further and more marked decline.
Saavedra Faxardo, indeed, who lived forty years out of Spain, employed
in diplomatic missions, was educated in a better school, and formed
himself on more worthy models, than he could have found among his
contemporaries at home; but his “History of the Goths in Spain” is an
imperfect work, published in 1646, at Munster, when he was there as a
member of the congress that made the peace of Westphalia, and was left
unfinished at his death, which occurred at Madrid two years later.<a
id="FNanchor_219" href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> The
only historian of eminence that remains to be noticed in this period
is, therefore, Solís.</p>

<p>Of him we have already spoken as a lyrical poet and a dramatist,
who in 1667 had retired from the world, and dedicated himself to
the separate service of religion. He was, however, the official
historiographer of the Indies, and thought himself bound to do
something in fulfilment of the duties of an office to which, perhaps,
a nominal income was attached. He chose for his subject “The Conquest
of Mexico,” and, beginning with the condition of Spain when it was
undertaken, and the appointment of Cortés to command the invading
force, he brings his history down to the fall of the city and the
capture of Guatimozin. The period it embraces is, indeed, short,—less
than three years; but they are years so crowded with brilliant
adventures and atrocious crimes, that hardly any portion of the
history of the world is of equal interest. The subject, too, from this
circumstance, is more easily managed; and Solís, who looked upon it
with the eye of an artist, as well as of an historian, has succeeded in
giving his work, to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[p. 165]</span>
an extraordinary degree, the air of an historical epic;—so exactly are
all its parts and episodes modelled into an harmonious whole, whose
catastrophe is the fall of the great Mexican empire.</p>

<p>The style of Solís is somewhat peculiar. That he had the Roman
historians, and especially Livy, before him, as he wrote, is apparent
both in the general air of his work and in the structure of its
individual sentences. Yet there are few writers of Spanish prose who
are more absolutely Castilian in their idiom than he is. His language,
if not simple, is rich and beautiful; suited to the romantic subject he
had chosen for his history, and deeply imbued with its poetical spirit.
In boldness of manner he falls below Mendoza, and in dignity is not
equal to Mariana; but for copious and sustained eloquence, he may be
placed by the side of either of them. That his work is as interesting
as either of theirs is proved by the unimpaired popularity it has
enjoyed from its first appearance down to our own times.</p>

<p>The Conquest of Mexico was written in the old age of its author, and
is darkened by the feelings that shut him out from the interests and
cares of the world. He refused to see the fierce and marvellous contest
which he recorded, except from the steps of the altar where he had been
consecrated. The Spaniards, therefore, are in his eyes only Christians;
the Mexicans, only heathen. The battle he witnesses and describes is
wholly between the powers of light and the legions of darkness; and
the unhappy Indians,—whom the Spaniards had no more right to invade,
in order to root out religious abominations, of which they had never
heard till after their landing, than Henry the Eighth or Elizabeth
had to invade Spain, in order to root out the<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_166">[p. 166]</span> abominations of the Spanish
Inquisition,—the unhappy Indians receive none of the historian’s
sympathy in the extremity of suffering they underwent during their
vain, but heroic, struggle for all that could make existence valuable
in their eyes.</p>

<p>The work of Solís, beautifully written and flattering to the
national vanity, was at once successful. But success was then a word
whose meaning was different from that which it bears now, or had borne
in Spain in the time of Lope de Vega. The publication, which took place
in 1684, by the assistance of a friend who defrayed the charges, found
its author poor and left him so. On this point there are passages in
his correspondence which it is painful to read;—one, for instance,
where he says, “I have many creditors who would stop me in the street,
if they saw I had new shoes on”; and another, where he asks a friend
for a warm garment to protect him from the winter’s cold. Still he was
gratified at the applause with which his work was received, though, at
the end of a year, only two hundred copies had been sold. Two years
afterwards he died, at the age of seventy-six, “leaving,” in the
technical phrase and the technical habit of the time, “his soul to be
the only heir of his body,” or, in other words, giving the remnants
of his poverty to purchase expiatory masses.<a id="FNanchor_220"
href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> Diego de Tovar, the
same ecclesiastic who had been confessor to Quevedo and Nicolas
Antonio, stood by the bedside of the dying man, and consoled the last
moments of Solís, as he had consoled theirs.<a id="FNanchor_221"
href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[p. 167]</span>Solís was the
last of the good writers in the elder school of Spanish history;—a
school which, even during its best days, numbered but few names, and
which, now that the whole literature of the country was decaying,
shared the general fate. Nor could it be otherwise. The spirit of
political tyranny in the government, and of religious tyranny in the
Inquisition,—now closer than ever united,—were more hostile to bold and
faithful inquiry in the department of history than in almost any other;
so that the generous national independence and honesty announced in
the old chronicles were stopped midway in their career, before half of
their power had been put forth.</p>

<p>Still, as we have seen, several of the historians that were produced
even under the overshadowing influence of the Austrian family were
not unworthy of the national character. Mariana shows much manly
firmness, Solís much fervor, Zurita much conscientious diligence, while
Mendoza, Moncada, Coloma, and Melo, who confined themselves to subjects
embracing shorter periods and less wide interests, have given us some
of the most striking sketches to be found in the historical literature
of any country. All of them are rich and dignified, abounding rather in
feeling than philosophy, and written in a tone and style that mark, not
so much, perhaps, the peculiar genius of their respective authors, as
that of the country that gave them birth; so that, though they may not
be entirely classical, they are entirely Spanish; and what they want in
finish and grace, they make up in picturesqueness and originality.<a

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> last department in the literature
of any country, that comes within the jurisdiction of criticism on
account of its style, is that of Didactic Prose; since in this branch,
so remote from every thing poetical, the ornaments of manner are more
accidental than they are elsewhere, and, beyond it, are not at all to
be exacted. In modern times, the French seem to have been more anxious
than any other nation, not excepting even the Italians, to add the
grace of an elegant style to their didactic prose, while, on the other
hand, none have been more unsuccessful than the Spaniards in their
attempts to cultivate it.</p>

<p>In one particular form of didactic composition, however,
Spain stands in advance of all other countries; I mean that of
Proverbs, which Cervantes has happily called “short sentences drawn
from long experience.”<a id="FNanchor_223" href="#Footnote_223"
class="fnanchor">[223]</a> Spanish proverbs can be traced back to
the earliest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[p. 170]</span>
times. One of the best known—“Laws go where kings please they
should”—is connected with an event of importance in the reign of
Alfonso the Sixth, who died in the beginning of the twelfth century,
when the language of Castile had hardly a distinct existence.<a
id="FNanchor_224" href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a>
Another has been traced to a custom belonging to the days of the
Infantes de Lara, and is itself probably of not much later date.<a
id="FNanchor_225" href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a>
Others are found in the General Chronicle, which is one of the
oldest of Spanish prose compositions, and among them is the happy
one on disappointed expectations, cited in Don Quixote more than
once: “He went for wool and came back shorn.”<a id="FNanchor_226"
href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a> Several occur
in the “Conde Lucanor” of Don John Manuel,<a id="FNanchor_227"
href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a> and many in the poetry
of the Archpriest of Hita,<a id="FNanchor_228" href="#Footnote_228"
class="fnanchor">[228]</a> both of whom lived in the time of Alfonso
the Eleventh.</p>

<p>Thus far, however, we have only separate and isolated sayings,
evidently belonging to the old Spanish race, and always used as if
quite familiar and notorious. But in the reign of John the Second, and
at his request, the Marquis of Santillana collected a hundred<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[p. 171]</span> in rhyme, which we have
already noticed, besides above six hundred, he says, such as the
old women were wont to repeat in their chimney-corners. From this
period, therefore, or rather from 1508, when this collection was
published, the old and wise proverbs of the language may be regarded
as having obtained a settled place in its didactic literature.<a
id="FNanchor_229" href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a></p>

<p>The number of proverbs, indeed, was soon so great,—not only those
floating about in the common talk of men, but those collected and
printed,—that they began to be turned to account. Garay, who was
attached to the cathedral of Toledo, and therefore lived in the
centre of whatever was peculiarly Castilian, wrote a long letter,
every sentence of which was a popular saying; to which he added two
similar letters, found, as he says, by accident, and made up, in
the same way, of proverbs.<a id="FNanchor_230" href="#Footnote_230"
class="fnanchor">[230]</a> But, in the middle of the century, a
still higher honor awaited the old Spanish adages. Pedro Valles,
who wrote the history of the great Marquis of Pescara, published an
alphabetical series of four thousand three hundred of them in 1549;
and the famous Greek scholar and distinguished nobleman, Hernan Nuñez
de Guzman, Professor successively at Alcalá and at Salamanca, found
amusement for his old age<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[p.
172]</span> in making another series of them, which amounted in all
to above six thousand. To some he added explanations; to others,
various parallel sayings from different languages; but, finding his
strength fail him, he gave the task to a friend, who, like himself,
was a Professor in Salamanca, and who published the whole in 1555,
two years after the death of Nuñez; rather, as he intimates, from
respect to the person from whom he received it, than from regard to the
dignity of the employment.<a id="FNanchor_231" href="#Footnote_231"
class="fnanchor">[231]</a></p>

<p>Out of these proverbs, another of the friends of Hernan Nuñez—Mal
Lara, a Sevilian—selected a thousand, and, adding a commentary to
each, published them in 1568, under the not inappropriate title of
“Philosophy of the Common People”; a volume which, notwithstanding its
cumbersome learning, can be read with pleasure, both for the style in
which many parts of it are written, and for the unusual historical
anecdotes with which it abounds. Another collection, made by Palmireno,
a Valencian, in 1569, consisting of above two hundred proverbs
appropriate to the table, shows how abundant popular aphorisms must be
in a language that can furnish so many on one subject. Yet another, by
Oudin, was published at Paris in 1608, for the use of foreigners, and
shows no less plainly how much the Spanish had become spread throughout
Europe. Sorapan, in 1616 and 1617, published two collections, in which
it was intended that the condensation of popular experience and wisdom
should teach medicine, as, in the hands of Mal Lara, they had been
made to teach the philosophy of life. And, finally, in 1675, Cejudo,
a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[p. 173]</span> schoolmaster of
Val de Peñas, gave the world about six thousand, with the corresponding
Latin adages, whenever he could find them, and with explanations
more satisfactory than had been furnished by his predecessors.<a

<p>Still, though so many thousands have been collected, many thousands
still remain unpublished, known only among the traditions of the
humbler classes of society, that have given birth to them all. Juan
de Yriarte, a learned man, who was nearly forty years at the head
of the King’s Library at Madrid, collected, about the middle of the
eighteenth century, no less than twenty-four thousand; and yet it is
not to be supposed that a single individual, however industrious,
living in Madrid, could exhaust their number, as they belong rather
to the provinces than to the capital, and are spread everywhere among
the common people, and through all their dialects.<a id="FNanchor_233"
href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a></p>

<p>Why proverbs should abound so much more in Spain than in any other
country of Christendom, it is not possible to tell. Perhaps the Arabs,
whose language is rich in such wisdom, may have furnished some of
them;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[p. 174]</span> or perhaps
the whole mass may have sprung from the original soil of the less
cultivated classes of Spanish society. But however this may be, we know
they are often among the pleasantest and most characteristic ornaments
of the national literature; and those who are most familiar with them
will be most ready to agree with the wise author of the “Dialogue on
Languages,” when he says, and repeats the remark, that we must go to
the old national proverbs for what is purest in his native Castilian.<a
id="FNanchor_234" href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a></p>


<p class="mt2">Turning now to the proper Didactic prose of Spanish
literature, the first instance we find—after those formerly noticed
as imitating the Italian philosophical discussions of the sixteenth
century—is one that comes near to the borders of fiction. It is “The
Garden of Curious Flowers,” by Torquemada, originally published in
1570, of which the curate, in the scrutiny of Don Quixote’s library,
says, that “he does not know whether it is more true, or, to speak
strictly, less full of lies,” than the “Olivante de Laura,” a book
of chivalry by the same author, which, for its peculiar absurdities,
he sends at once to the bonfire in the court-yard. “The Garden of
Curious Flowers,” however, is still a curious book. It consists of
six colloquies between friends, who talk for their amusement on such
subjects as the monstrous productions of nature, the terrestrial
paradise, phantasms and enchantments, the influence of the stars, and
the history and condition of those countries<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_175">[p. 175]</span> that lie nearest to the North Pole. It
is, in fact, a collection of whatever strange and extravagant stories a
learned man could make, beginning with such as he found in Aristotle,
Pliny, Solinus, Olaus Magnus, and Albertus Magnus, and including those
told by the most credulous of his own time. Being put into a form
then popular, and related in a pleasing style, they had no little
success. They were several times printed in the original, and, beside
being translated into Italian and French, are well known to those
who are curious in the literature of Queen Elizabeth’s time, under
the much-abused name of “The Spanish Mandeville.” It may be added,
that some of Torquemada’s accounts of spectres and visions are still
pleasant reading; and that, though Cervantes spoke slightingly of the
whole book in his “Don Quixote,” he afterwards resorted to it, both for
facts and for fancies respecting the wonders of Friesland and Iceland,
when he wrote the first part of his “Persiles and Sigismunda.”<a
id="FNanchor_235" href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a></p>

<p>Christóval de Acosta, a Portuguese botanist,—who was accustomed to
call himself “the African,” because he happened to be born in one of
the African possessions of Portugal,—travelled much in the East, and
after his return published, in 1578, a work on Oriental plants and
drugs, to which he added at the end a treatise on the natural history
of the Elephant. But, though he succeeded in attracting the attention
of Europe to this publication, and though the early part of his life
had been that of a soldier, an adventurer, and a<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_176">[p. 176]</span> captive among pirates and robbers,
he spent many of his later years, if not all of them, in religious
retirement at home, where, besides other things, he wrote a discourse
on “The Benefits of Solitude,” and a treatise on “The Praise of Women.”
The last was printed in 1592, and, except that it is too full of
learning, may still be read with some interest, if not with pleasure.<a
id="FNanchor_236" href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a></p>

<p>It was not, however, moral and philosophical writers, like Oliva
and Guevara, nor writers on subjects connected with natural history,
like Torquemada and Acosta, that were most favored in the reigns of
Philip the Second and his immediate successors. It was the ascetics and
mystics,—the natural produce of the soil of Spain, and, almost without
exception, faithful to the old Castilian genius.</p>

<p>Among the most prominent of this class was Luis de Granada,
distinguished as a Spanish preacher, but still more remarkable for
his eloquence as a mystic. His “Meditations for the Seven Days and
Nights of a Week,” his treatises “On Prayer” and “On Faith,” and his
“Memorial of a Christian Life,” were early translated into Latin,
Italian, French, and English,—one of them into Turkish, and one into
Japanese,—and, like his other Spanish works, have continued to be
printed and admired in the original down to our own times.</p>

<p>The most effective of them all was his “Guide for Sinners,” first
published in 1556. It makes two moderate volumes, and portions of it
are marked with a diffuse<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[p.
177]</span> declamation, which is perhaps imitated from that of Juan
de Avila, the Apostle of Andalusia, whose friend and follower he more
than once boasts himself to have been. But its general tone is that
of a moving and harmonious eloquence, which has made it a favorite
book of devotion in Spain ever since it first appeared, and has spread
its reputation so widely, that it has been translated into nearly all
the languages of Europe, including the Greek and Polish, and, at one
time, seemed likely to obtain a place, in the religious literature of
Christendom, very near that of the great ascetic work which passes
under the name of Thomas à Kempis. In its native country, however, the
Guide for Sinners encountered at first not a little opposition. As
early as the year after it was published, it had been placed on the
Index Expurgatorius, and no edition except the first seems to have
been permitted till we find that of Salamanca, in 1570. But the very
Index that condemned it became itself the subject of condemnation; and,
in the case of the Guide for Sinners, the ecclesiastical powers went
so far in the opposite direction as to grant special indulgences by
proclamation to all who should have read or heard a chapter of the very
work they had earlier so harshly censured.</p>

<p>Luis de Granada passed all the latter part of his life in
Lisbon,—perhaps because he had been repeatedly annoyed by the
Inquisition at home, perhaps because his duties seemed to lead him
there. But, whatever may have been the cause, it is certain that he
enjoyed much more favor in Portugal than he did in Spain; and when
he died, in 1588, eighty-four years old, he could boast that he had
refused the highest honors of the Portuguese Church, and humbly
devoted the whole of his long life to the reformation and advancement
of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[p. 178]</span> the Order
of Preachers, of which, during his best years, he had been the
active and venerated head.<a id="FNanchor_237" href="#Footnote_237"
class="fnanchor">[237]</a></p>

<p>San Juan de la Cruz, who was in some respects an imitator of Luis
de Granada, was born in 1542, and, having spent the greater part of
his life in reforming the discipline of the Carmelite monasteries,
died in 1591, and was beatified in 1674. His works, which are chiefly
contemplative, and obtained for him the title of the Ecstatic
Doctor, are written with great fervor. The chief of them are the
allegory of “The Ascent to Mount Carmel,” and “The Dark Night of the
Soul,”—treatises which have given him much reputation for a mystical
eloquence, that sometimes rises to the sublime, and sometimes is
lost in the unintelligible. His poetry, of which a little is printed
in some of the many editions of his works, is of the same general
character, but marked by great felicity and richness of phraseology.<a
id="FNanchor_238" href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a></p>

<p>Santa Teresa, who was associated with Juan de la Cruz in the work
of reforming the Carmelites,—or rather with whom he was associated,
since hers was the leading spirit,—died in 1582, sixty-seven years
old. Her didactic works, the most remarkable of which are “The Path to
Perfection” and “The Interior Castle,” are less obscure than those of
her coadjutor, though more declamatory. But all she wrote, including
an account of her own life, and several discussions connected with the
religious duties to which she dedicated herself, were composed with
apparent reluctance on her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[p.
179]</span> part, and in obedience to the commands of her superiors.
She believed herself to be often in direct communion with God; and as
those about her shared her faith on this point, she was continually
urged by them to make known to the world what were thus regarded as
revelations of the Divine will. On one occasion she says: “Far within,
God appeared to me in a vision, as he has been wont to do, and gave me
his right hand, and said,—Behold this print of the nail; it is a sign
that, from this day forth, thou art my spouse. Hitherto, thou hast not
deserved it; but hereafter not only shalt thou regard my honor as that
of thy Creator, and King, and God, but as that of a true spouse;—for my
honor is now thine, and thine is mine.”</p>

<p>Living, as she undoubtedly did, under the persuasion that she was
favored with numberless revelations of this kind, she wrote boldly
and rapidly, and corrected nothing. Her style, in consequence, is
diffuse and open to objections, which, in Spain, the spirit of a merely
literary criticism is too reverent to desire to remove. But whatever
she wrote is full of earnestness, sincerity, and love; and therefore
her works have never ceased to be read by those of her own nation and
faith. During her life, she was persecuted by the Inquisition; but
after her death, her manuscripts were collected with pious care, and
published, in 1588, by Luis de Leon, who exhorts all men to follow in
the bright path she has pointed out to them; adding, “She has seen
God face to face, and she now shows him to you.”<a id="FNanchor_239"
href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a></p> <p><span
class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[p. 180]</span></p> <p>This school of
spiritualists, to which belonged Juan de Avila and Luis de Leon, of
whom we have before spoken, had, no doubt, a very considerable effect
on Spanish didactic prose. They raised its tone, and did more towards
placing it on the old foundations, where the chronicles and the earlier
writers of the country, like Lucena, had left it, than had been done
for nearly two centuries. Such efforts gave dignity, if not purity or
an exact finish, to the proper Castilian style; so that, at the end of
the reign of Philip the Second, it was not only of more consequence to
an author’s reputation to write well upon any grave subject in prose
than it had ever been before, but, with such examples before him, it
was easier to do so. In all this, the movement made was in the right
direction, and produced happy results. But, on the other hand, we
should remember that it confirmed in the didactic literature of the
country that tendency to a diffuse and florid declamation, which was
early one of its blemishes, and from which, with such authority in
its favor, Castilian prose has never since been able completely to
emancipate itself.</p>

<p>A remarkable proof of this is to be found in “The Magdalen” of
Malon de Chaide, first published in 1592, after the death of its
author. It is a religious work, and is divided into four parts; the
first being merely introductory, and the three others on the three
characters of Mary Magdalen as a sinner, a penitent, and a saint. It
has a very rhetorical air throughout, and sometimes reads almost like
a romance;—so free is its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[p.
181]</span> conception of the character and conversations of the
saint. But some of its discussions, like one on fashionable dress,
and one on religious pictures, are curious; and some of its religious
exhortations, like that to repent before old age comes on, are moving
and powerful. The moral tone of the whole is severe. With a great
deal of the spirit of a monk, the author is earnest against books of
chivalry; and he not only rebukes the habit of reading the ancient
classics, but even such Spanish poets as Garcilasso de la Vega,
because he thinks admiration of them inconsistent with a preservation
of the Christian character. Occasionally, he grows mystical; and
then, though his style is more than ever prodigal, his meaning is not
always plain. But, on the whole, and regarded as an exhortation to a
religious life, the Conversion of Mary Magdalen is written with so
much richness of language, and is often so eloquent, that it was much
read when it first appeared, and has not, even in recent times, ceased
to be reprinted and admired.<a id="FNanchor_240" href="#Footnote_240"
class="fnanchor">[240]</a></p>

<p>Quite different from this is “The Amusing Journey” of Roxas,—a
book that hardly falls within the strict limits of any class, but one
which has always been popular in Spain. Its author was an actor; and
his travels consist of an account of some of his personal adventures
and experiences, thrown into the form of dialogues between three
of his fellow-comedians and himself, as they<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_182">[p. 182]</span> visit some of the principal cities of
Spain in the exercise of their profession as strolling players. They
travel on foot; and their conversations, which are little molested by
scruples of any sort, make up a very amusing book.</p>

<p>In some parts of it, we have sketches of the places they visit,
with notices of the local history belonging to each. In others, Roxas
himself, in a spirit that not unfrequently reminds us of Gil Blas,
relates his own previous adventures, as a soldier, as a captive in
France, and as a play-actor at home. In yet others, we have fictions,
or what seem to be such, and among them, the story on which Shakspeare
founded his Christopher Sly and the Induction to “The Taming of the
Shrew.” But, in general, it is rather an account of what relates to
the theatre and the affairs of the four gay companions at Seville,
Toledo, Segovia, Valladolid, Granada, and on the roads between all
of them, interspersed with forty or fifty <i>loas</i>, which Roxas wrote
with recognized success, and of which he is evidently very proud.
It is a pleasant book, loosely and carelessly put together, but
important for the history of the Spanish drama, and with talent
enough to attract the attention of Scarron, who took from it the
hint for his “Roman Comique.” From internal evidence, “The Amusing
Journey” was written in 1602, and, at the end, a continuation is
announced; but, like so many other promises of the same sort in Spanish
literature, it was never kept.<a id="FNanchor_241" href="#Footnote_241"
class="fnanchor">[241]</a></p>

<p>Perhaps the work of Roxas served, also, as a hint for<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[p. 183]</span> the “Pasagero,” or
Traveller, of Suarez de Figueroa. At any rate, the well-known author
of the “Amarillis,” published in 1617, a half-narrative, half-didactic
work with this title, containing ten long discussions, on a great
variety of subjects, held by four persons, as they journey from Madrid
to Barcelona, in order to embark for Italy;—the discussions themselves
being called <i>alivios</i>, or rests by the way. The chief conversation
is in the hands of Figueroa, the principal person in his own drama;
and so far as he is concerned, and so far as the discussions relate
to the men of letters of his own time, the Pasagero is somewhat
cynical. His autobiography, which is contained in the eighth dialogue,
is interesting, and so are the ninth and tenth dialogues, in which
he gives his view of the state of Spain at the time he wrote, and
the means of leading an honest and honorable life there. But the
most important conversations are the third, which relates to the
theatre, and the fourth, which is on the popular and courtly mode
of preaching. The whole work is too diffuse in its style, though
less declamatory than much in the didactic prose of the period.<a
id="FNanchor_242" href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[p. 184]</span></p> <p>Some
of the best portions of the didactic literature of Spain during the
seventeenth century were partly or wholly political. Marquez, a writer
in the old style of the reign of Philip the Second, published in 1612
his “Christian Governor,” a work composed at the request of the Duke
of Feria, then viceroy of Sicily, and intended to serve as an answer
to Machiavelli’s “Prince.”<a id="FNanchor_243" href="#Footnote_243"
class="fnanchor">[243]</a> Vera y Zuñiga, author of a strange epic
on the conquest of Seville, who was a better minister of Philip
the Third than he was poet, published in 1620 a treatise, in four
discourses, on the character and duties of an ambassador; full of
learning, and occasionally illustrated with appropriate anecdotes
drawn from Spanish history, but citing indiscriminately books of
authority and no authority on the grave subjects he discusses, and
relying apparently with as much confidence upon an opinion of Ovid
as upon one of Comines.<a id="FNanchor_244" href="#Footnote_244"
class="fnanchor">[244]</a> Fernandez de Navarrete, a secretary of
the same monarch, chose his subject a little higher up, and in
1625, under the disguise of an assumed name, and in a letter to a
Polish prime-minister who never existed, gave the world his notions
of what “a royal favorite” should be; but it is evident that Spain
only was in his thoughts when he wrote, and his little treatise is
so encumbered with ill-assorted learning and ungraceful conceits
that it was soon forgotten.<a id="FNanchor_245" href="#Footnote_245"
class="fnanchor">[245]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[p. 185]</span>Not so the
“Idea of a Christian Prince,” by Saavedra Faxardo, who died at Madrid
in 1648, after having been long in the diplomatic service of the
Spanish crown. It was a higher subject than either of those taken
by Navarrete and Figueroa, and managed with more talent. Under the
awkward arrangement of a hundred ingenious Emblems, with mottoes,
that are generally well chosen and pointed, he has given a hundred
essays on the education of a prince;—his relations with his ministers
and subjects; his duties as the head of a state in its internal and
external relations; and his duties to himself in old age and in
preparation for death;—all intended for the instruction of Balthasar,
son of Philip the Fourth, to whom it is dedicated, but who died too
young to profit by its wisdom. It is written in a compact, sententious
style, with much quaint and curious knowledge of history, and with
a large and not always judicious display of learning. But in many
points it reminds us of Sir Walter Raleigh’s “Cabinet Council” and
Owen Feltham’s “Resolves”;—a measure of praise that can be given to
few such prose works in the Spanish language. Its success was great;
nor is it yet fallen into neglect. The first edition was published in
1640, at Munster. Many others followed in the course of the century.
It was translated into all the languages of Europe, and, in Spain at
least, has continued to be printed and valued down to our own days.<a
id="FNanchor_246" href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[p. 186]</span></p> <p>“The
Divine Politics” of Quevedo, a part of which was published before
the Christian Prince and a part after it, may have suggested his
subject to Saavedra, but not the mode of treating it; and, in the same
way, the great satirist may have had some influence in determining
Antonio de Vega, the Portuguese, to write his “Political Dream of a
Perfect Nobleman,” in 1620;<a id="FNanchor_247" href="#Footnote_247"
class="fnanchor">[247]</a> Nieremberg, the Jesuit, to write his “Manual
for Gentlemen and Princes,” which appeared in 1629;<a id="FNanchor_248"
href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a> and Benavente, his
“Advice for Kings, Princes, and Ambassadors,” which appeared in 1643.<a
id="FNanchor_249" href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a> But
none of these works, nor any thing else in the nature of didactic<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[p. 187]</span> prose that appeared in
the seventeenth century, is equal to the Christian Prince of Saavedra;
unless, indeed, we are to except his own vision of a state, which he
calls “The Literary Republic,” and in which he discusses somewhat
satirically, but in a vein of agreeable criticism, the merits of the
principal writers of ancient and modern times, foreign and Spanish. The
Literary Republic, however, was not published till after its author’s
death, and never enjoyed a popularity like that enjoyed by his longer
and elder work; a work which leaves far behind every thing in the
class of books of emblems, that so long served to tax the ingenuity
of the higher classes of society in Europe.<a id="FNanchor_250"
href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a></p>

<p>To these writers of the end of the sixteenth and the first half of
the seventeenth century a few more might be added, of less consequence.
Juan de Guzman, in 1589, published a formal treatise on Rhetoric, in
the seventh dialogue of which he makes an ingenious application of
the rules of the Greek and Roman masters to the demands of modern
sermonizing in Spain.<a id="FNanchor_251" href="#Footnote_251"
class="fnanchor">[251]</a> Gracian Dantisco, one of the secretaries
of Philip the Second, published in 1599 a small discourse on the
minor morals of life, which he called the “Galateo,” in imitation of
Giovanni della Casa, whose classical Italian treatise bearing the
same name was already translated into Spanish.<a id="FNanchor_252"
href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a> In the same year
appeared a curious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[p. 188]</span>
work by Pedro de Andrada, on “The Art of Horsemanship,” well written
and learned, with amusing anecdotes of horses; and this was followed,
in 1605, by a similar treatise of Simon de Villalobos, but one
which, from its more military character, and from the exaggerated
importance it gives to its subject, might well have been made a part
of Don Quixote’s library.<a id="FNanchor_253" href="#Footnote_253"
class="fnanchor">[253]</a> Both of them bear marks of the state of
society at the time they were written.</p>

<p>Paton, the author of several works of little value, published, in
1604, a crude treatise on “The Art of Spanish Eloquence,” founded on
the rules of the ancients;<a id="FNanchor_254" href="#Footnote_254"
class="fnanchor">[254]</a> and, in Mexico, Aleman, while living
there, printed, in 1609, a treatise on “Castilian Orthography,”
which, besides what is appropriate to the title, contains pleasant
discussions on other topics connected with the language, over which
he has himself shown a great mastery in his “Guzman de Alfarache.”<a
id="FNanchor_255" href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a>
A series of conversations on miscellaneous subjects, divided into
seven nights, which their author, Faria y Sousa, intended to have
called simply “Moral Dialogues,” but which his bookseller, without
his knowledge, published in 1624 with the title of “Brilliant
Nights,” are dull and pedantic, like nearly every thing this learned
Portuguese wrote; and the second part, which he offered to the public,
was never called for.<a id="FNanchor_256" href="#Footnote_256"
class="fnanchor">[256]</a> And, finally, an<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_189">[p. 189]</span>other Portuguese, Francisco de
Portugal, who died in 1632,<a id="FNanchor_257" href="#Footnote_257"
class="fnanchor">[257]</a> wrote a pleasant treatise on “The Art
of Gallantry,” with anecdotes showing the state of fashionable, or
rather courtly, society at the time; but it was not printed till long
after its author’s death.<a id="FNanchor_258" href="#Footnote_258"
class="fnanchor">[258]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[p. 190]</span>During the
period embraced by the works last mentioned, a false taste had invaded
Spanish prose. It was the same unhappy taste which we have noticed
in Spanish poetry by the name of “Gongorism,” but which its admirers
called sometimes “the polite,” and sometimes “the cultivated,” style of
writing. Traces of it have been sought in the sixteenth century among
some of the best writers of the country; but for this there seems no
foundation, except in the fact, that a rigorous taste never at any
time prevailed in Spain, and that the luxuriant success of letters
towards the end of the reign of Philip the Second, and the consequent
difficulty of obtaining fashionable distinction by authorship, had
led to occasional affectations even in the style of those who, like
Cervantes and Mariana, stood foremost among the better writers of their
time.</p>

<p>But now, the admiration that followed Góngora almost necessarily
introduced conceits into prose writing, such as were thought so worthy
of imitation in poetry. Those, therefore, who most coveted public
favor, began to play with words, and seek to surprise by an unexpected
opposition of ideas and quaintness of metaphor, little consistent
with the old Castilian dignity, until at last they quite left the
stately constructions in which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[p.
191]</span> resides so much of what is peculiar to the sonorous
declamations of Luis de Leon and Luis de Granada, and by excessive
efforts at brilliancy became so involved and obscure, that they were
not always intelligible. Instances of such affectation may be found in
Saavedra and Francisco de Portugal. But the innovation itself is older
than either of their published works. It broke out with Paravicino,
who, besides imitating Góngora’s poetry, as we have already seen,
carried similar extravagances of metaphor and construction into his
oratorical and didactic prose; intimating, in a characteristic phrase,
that he claimed the honor of being the Columbus who had made this great
discovery. As early as 1620, it was matter of censure and ridicule
to Liñan, in his “Guide to Strangers in Madrid,” and soon afterwards
to Mateo Velazquez, in his “Village Philosopher”; so that from this
period we may consider <i>cultismo</i> nearly or quite as prevalent in
Spanish prose as it was in Spanish poetry.<a id="FNanchor_259"
href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a></p>

<p>The person, however, who settled its character, and in some respects
gave it an air of philosophical pretension, was Balthazar Gracian, a
Jesuit of Aragon, who lived between 1601 and 1658; exactly the period
when the cultivated style took possession of Spanish prose, and rose
to its greatest consideration. He began in 1630, by a tract called
“The Hero,” which is not so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[p.
192]</span> much the description of a hero’s character as it is a
recipe to form one, given in short, compact sentences, constructed in
the new style. It was successful, and was followed by five or six other
works, written in the same manner; after which, to confirm and justify
them all, there appeared, in 1648, his “Agudeza y Arte de Ingenio”; a
regular Art of Poetry, or rather system of rhetoric, accommodated to
the school of Góngora, and showing great acuteness, especially in the
ingenuity with which the author presses into his service the elder
poets, such as Diego de Mendoza, the Argensolas, and even Luis de Leon
and the Bachiller de la Torre.</p>

<p>The most remarkable work of Gracian, however, is his “Críticon,”
published in three parts, between 1650 and 1653. It is an allegory on
human life, and gives us the adventures of Critilus, a noble Spaniard,
wrecked on the desert island of Saint Helena, where he finds a solitary
savage, who knows nothing about himself, except that he has been nursed
by a wild beast. After much communication in dumb show, they are able
to understand each other in Spanish, and, being taken from the island,
travel together through the world, talking often of the leading men
of their time in Spain, but holding intercourse more with allegorical
personages than with one another. The story of their adventures is
long, and its three portions represent the three periods of human
life; the first being called the Spring of Childhood, the second the
Autumn of Manhood, and the third the Winter of Old Age. In some parts
it shows much talent; and eloquent discussions on moral subjects, and
glowing descriptions of events and natural scenery, can be taken from
it, which are little infected with the extravagances of the Cultivated
Style. Sometimes, we are reminded of the “Pilgrim’s Progress,”—as, for
instance,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[p. 193]</span> in the
scenes of the World’s Fair,—and might almost say, that the “Críticon”
is to the Catholic religion and the notions of life in Spain during the
reign of Philip the Fourth, what Bunyan’s fiction is to Puritanism and
the English character in the age of Cromwell. But there is no vitality
in the shadowy personages of Gracian. He bodies nothing forth to which
our sympathies can attach themselves as they do to such sharply-defined
creations as Christian and Mr. Greatheart, and, when we are moved at
all by him, it is only by his acuteness and eloquence.</p>

<p>His other works are of little value, and are yet more deformed by
bad taste; especially his “Politico-Fernando,” which is an extravagant
eulogium on Ferdinand the Catholic, and his “Discreto,” which is a
collection of prose miscellanies, including a few of his letters. It
is singular, that, in consequence of being an ecclesiastic, he thought
it proper that all his works should be printed under the name of his
brother Lorenzo, who lived at Seville; and it is yet more singular,
perhaps, that they were published, not by himself, but by his friend,
Lastañosa, a gentleman of literary taste, and a collector of ancient
works of art, who lived at Huesca in Aragon. But however indirectly
and cautiously the works of Gracian won their way into the world,
they enjoyed great favor there, and made much noise. His “Hero” went
early through six editions, and his collected prose works, most of
which were translated into French and Italian, and some of them into
English and Latin, were often reprinted in the original Spanish,
both at home and abroad.<a id="FNanchor_260" href="#Footnote_260"
class="fnanchor">[260]</a></p> <p><span class="pagenum"
id="Page_194">[p. 194]</span></p> <p>From this period, the rich old
prose style of Luis de Leon and his contemporaries may be said to have
been driven out of Spanish literature. Lope de Vega and Quevedo, after
resisting the innovations of <i>cultismo</i> for a time, had long before
yielded, and Calderon was now alternately assailing the depraved taste
of his audiences and gratifying it by running into extravagances almost
as great as those he ridiculed. The language of the most affected
poetry passed into the prose of the age, and took from it the power and
dignity which, even in its more declamatory portions, had constituted
its prominent merit. Style became fantastic, and the very thoughts that
were to be conveyed were not unfrequently covered up with ingenuities
of illustration till they disappeared. In the phrase of Sancho,
men wanted better bread than could be made of wheat, and rendered
themselves ridiculous by attempting to obtain it. Tropes and figures
of all kinds were settled into formulas of speech, and then were
repeated appropriately and inappropriately, till the reader could often
anticipate, from the beginning of a sentence, how it would inevitably
end. Every thing, indeed, in prose composition, as in poetry, announced
that corrupted taste which both precedes and hastens the decay of a
literature; and which, in the case of Spain during the latter half of
the seventeenth century, was but the concomitant of a general decline
in the arts and the gradual degradation of the monarchy.</p>

<p>Among those who wrote best, though still infected with the
prevailing influences, was Zabaleta. His “Moral Problems” and
“Famous Errors,” but espe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[p.
195]</span>cially his “Feast Days at Madrid,” in which he gives
lively satirical sketches of the manners of the metropolis at those
periods when idleness brings the people into the streets and places
of amusement, are worth reading. But he lived in the reign of Philip
the Fourth; and so did Lozano, whose different ascetic works on the
character of King David, if not so good as his historical romance on
the New Kings of Toledo, are better than any thing else of the kind
in the same period. They are, however, the last that can be read. The
reign of Charles the Second does not offer examples even so favorable
as these of the remains and ruins of a better taste. “The Labors of
Hercules,” by Heredia, in 1682, and the “Moral Essays on Boëthius,” by
Ramirez, in 1698, if they serve for nothing else, serve at least to
mark the ultimate limits of dulness and affectation. Indeed, if it were
not for the History of Solís, which has been already noticed, we should
look in vain for an instance of respectable prose composition after
this last and most degenerate descendant of the House of Austria had
mounted the Spanish throne.<a id="FNanchor_261" href="#Footnote_261"
class="fnanchor">[261]</a></p> <p><span class="pagenum"
id="Page_196">[p. 196]</span></p> <p>Nor is this remarkable. On the
contrary, it is rather to be considered worthy of notice, that didactic
prose should have had any merit or obtained any success in Spain during
the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. For the end it proposes is
not, like that of poetry, to amuse, but, like that of philosophy, to
enlighten and amend; and how dangerous in Spain was the social position
of any teacher or moral monitor, who claimed for himself that degree of
independence of opinion without which instruction becomes a dead form,
needs not now to be set forth. Few persons, in that unhappy country,
were surrounded with more difficulties; none were more strictly
watched, or, if they wandered from the permitted paths, were more
severely punished.</p>

<p>Nor was it possible for such persons, by the most notorious
earnestness in their convictions of the just control of the religion
of the state, or any degree of faithfulness in their loyalty, to avoid
sometimes falling under the rebuke of the jealousy that watched each
step of their course; a fact sufficiently apparent, when we recollect
that nearly all the didactic writers of merit during this period, such
as Juan de Avila, Luis de Leon, Luis de Granada, Quevedo, San Juan
de la Cruz, and Santa Teresa, were persecuted by the Inquisition or
by the government, and the works of every one of them expurgated or
forbidden.</p>

<p>Under such oppression, free and eloquent writers,—men destined to
teach and advance their generation,—could not be expected to appear,
and the few who ventured into ways so dangerous dwelt as much as
possible in generals, and became mystical, like Juan de la Cruz, or
extravagant and declamatory, like Luis de Granada. Nearly all,—strictly
prevented from using the logic of a wise and liberal philosophy,—fell
into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[p. 197]</span> pedantry, from
an anxious desire, wherever it was possible, to lean upon authority;
so that, from Luis de Leon down to the most ordinary writer, who,
in a prefatory letter of approbation, wished to give currency to
the opinions of a friend, no man seemed to feel at ease unless he
could justify and sustain what he had to say by citations from the
Scriptures, the fathers of the Church, and the ancient and scholastic
philosophers. Thus, Spanish didactic prose, which, from its original
elements and tendencies, seemed destined to wear the attractions of
an elevated and eloquent style, gradually became so formal, awkward,
and pedantic, that, with a few striking exceptions, it can only be
said to have maintained a doubtful and difficult existence during the
long period when the less suspected and less oppressed portions of the
literature of the country—its drama and its lyric poetry—were in the
meridian of their success.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is impossible to study with care
the Spanish literature of the seventeenth century, and not feel that
we are in the presence of a general decay of the national character.
At every step, as we advance, the number of writers that surround
us is diminished. In what crowds they were gathered together during
the reigns of Philip the Second and Philip the Third, we may see
in the long lists of poets given by Cervantes in his “Galatea” and
his “Journey to Parnassus,” and by Lope de Vega in his “Laurel of
Apollo.” But in the reign of Philip the Fourth, though the theatre,
from accidental circumstances, flourished more than ever, the other
departments showed symptoms of decline; and in the reign of Charles the
Second, wherever we turn, the number of authors sinks away, till it is
obvious that some great change must take place, or elegant literature
in Spain will speedily become extinct.</p>

<p>The public interest, too, in the few writers that remained, was
gone. At least, that general, national interest, which alone can
sustain the life it alone can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[p.
199]</span> give to the literature of any country, was no longer there;
and all the favor, that Spanish poets and men of letters enjoyed at the
end of the century, came from the court and the superficial fashion of
the time, which patronized the affected style of those followers of
Góngora, whose bad taste seemed to go on increasing in extravagance, as
talent among them grew more rare.</p>

<p>Every thing, meanwhile, announced, that the great foundations of the
national character were giving way on all sides; and that the failing
literature of the country was only one of the phases and signs of the
coming overthrow of its institutions. The decay which was so visible
on the surface of things had, however, long mined unseen beneath what
had been thought a period of extraordinary security and glory. Charles
the Fifth, while, on the one side, by the war of the <i>Comuneros</i>, he
had crushed nearly all of political liberty that Cardinal Ximenes had
left in the old constitutions of Castile, had given, on the other, by
his magnificent foreign conquests, a false direction to the character
of his people at home;—both tending alike to waste away that vigor
and independence which the Moorish wars had nourished in the hearts
of the nation, and which had so long constituted its real strength.
Philip the Second had been less successful than his father in his
great labors to advance the permanent prosperity of the monarchy. He
had, indeed, added Portugal and the Philippine Islands to his empire,
which now comprehended above a hundred millions of human beings, and
seemed to threaten the interests of all the rest of Europe. But such
doubtful benefits were heavily overbalanced by the religious rebellion
of the Netherlands, the fatal source of unnumbered mischiefs; by the
exhausting wars with Elizabeth of England and Henry the Fourth<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[p. 200]</span> of France; by the
contempt for labor, that followed the extraordinary prevalence of
a spirit of military adventure, and broke down the industry of the
country; by the vast increase of the ecclesiastical institutions, which
created a ruinous amount of pensioned idleness; and by the wasteful
luxury brought in with the gold of America, which seemed to corrupt
whatever it touched; so that, when that wary prince died, he left an
impoverished people, whose energies he had overstrained and impaired
by his despotism, and whose character he had warped and misdirected
by his unrelenting and unscrupulous bigotry.<a id="FNanchor_262"
href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a></p>

<p>His successor, feeble-minded and superstitious, was neither
able to repair the results of such mischiefs, nor to contend with
the difficulties they entailed upon his country. The power of the
clergy, grown enormous by the favor of Philip the Second and the
consolidated influence of the Jesuits, continued to gain strength, as
it were of itself; and, under the direct persuasions of this mighty
hierarchy, nearly six hundred thousand descendants of Moors—who,
though preserving, as their fathers had done for a century, the
external appearances of Christianity, were yet suspected of being
Mohammedans at heart—were now, by a great crime of state, expelled
from the land of their birth; a crime followed by injuries to the
agriculture and wealth of the South of Spain, and indeed of the whole
country, from which they have never recovered.<a id="FNanchor_263"
href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a></p> <p><span
class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[p. 201]</span></p> <p>The easy, gay
selfishness of Philip the Fourth, and the open profligacy of his
ministers, gave increased ac<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[p.
202]</span>tivity to the causes that were hastening on the threatened
ruin. Catalonia broke out into rebellion; Jamaica was seized by the
English; Roussillon was ceded to France; Portugal, which had never
been heartily incorporated into the monarchy, resumed her ancient
place among the independent nations of the earth;—every thing, in
short, showed how the external relations of the state were disturbed
and endangered. Its internal condition, meanwhile, was no less shaken.
The coin, notwithstanding the wise warnings of Mariana, had been
adulterated anew; the taxes had been shamelessly increased, while the
interest on the ever-growing public debt was dishonestly diminished.
Men, everywhere, began to be alarmed at the signs of the times. The
timid took shelter in celibacy and the institutions of the Church. The
bolder emigrated. At last, the universal pressure began to be visible
in the state of the population. Whole towns and villages were deserted.
Seville, the ancient capital of the monarchy, lost three quarters<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[p. 203]</span> of its inhabitants;
Toledo one third; Segovia, Medina del Campo, and others of the large
cities, fell off still more, not only in their numbers and opulence,
but in whatever goes to make up the great aggregate of civilization.
The whole land, in fact, was impoverished, and was falling into a
premature decay.</p>

<p>The necessary results of such a deplorable state of things are yet
more apparent in the next reign,—the unhappy reign of Charles the
Second,—which began with the troubles incident to a long minority, and
ended with a failure in the regular line of succession, and a contest
for the throne. It was a dreary period, with marks of dilapidation and
ruin on all sides. Beginning at the southern borders of France, and
following the coast by Barcelona and Gibraltar round to Cadiz, not
one of the great fortresses, which were the keys of the kingdom, was
in a state to defend itself against the most moderate force by which
it might be assailed. On the Atlantic, the old arsenals, from which
the Armada had gone forth, were empty; and the art of ship-building
had been so long neglected, that it was almost, or quite lost.<a
id="FNanchor_264" href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a> And,
in the capital and at court, the revenues of the country, which had
long been exhausted and anticipated, were at last unable to provide
for the common wants of the government, and sometimes even failed
to furnish forth the royal table with its accustomed propriety; so
that the envoy of Austria expressed his regret at having accepted
the place of ambassador at a court where he was compelled to witness
a misery so discreditable.<a id="FNanchor_265" href="#Footnote_265"
class="fnanchor">[265]</a></p>

<p>It was a new lesson to the world in the vicissitudes<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[p. 204]</span> of empire. No country
in Christendom had, from such a height of power as that which Spain
occupied in the time of Charles the Fifth, fallen into such an abyss
of degradation as that in which every proud Spaniard felt Spain to be
sunk, when the last of the great House of Austria approached the grave,
believing himself to be under the influence of sorcery, and seeking
relief by exorcisms which would have disgraced the credulity of the
Middle Ages;—all, too, at the time when France was jubilant with the
victories of Condé, and England preparing for the age of Marlborough.<a
id="FNanchor_266" href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a></p>

<p>In any country, such a decay in the national character and power
would be accompanied by a corresponding, if not an equal, decay in its
literature; but in Spain, where both had always been so intimately
connected, and where both had rested, in such a remarkable degree,
on the same foundations, the wise who looked on from a distance
could not fail to anticipate a rapid and disastrous decline of all
that was intellectual and elegant. And so, in fact, it proved. The
old religion of the country,—the most prominent of all the national
characteristics,—the mighty impulse which, in the days of the Moors,
had done every thing but work miracles,—was now so perverted from
its true character by the enormous growth of the intolerance which
sprang up originally almost as a virtue, that it had become a means of
oppression such as Europe had never before witnessed. Through the whole
period of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries which we have just
gone over,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[p. 205]</span>—from
the fall of Granada to the extinction of the Austrian dynasty,—the
Inquisition, as the grand exponent of the power of religion in Spain,
had maintained, not only an uninterrupted authority, but, by constantly
increasing its relations to the state, and lending itself more and more
freely to the punishment of whatever was obnoxious to the government,
had effectually broken down all that remained, from earlier days, of
intellectual independence and manly freedom. But this was not done, and
could not be done, without the assent of the great body of the people,
or without such an active coöperation on the part of the government and
the higher classes as brought degradation and ruin to all who shared in
its spirit.</p>

<p>Unhappily, this spirit, mistaken for the religion that had sustained
them through their long-protracted contest with their infidel invaders,
was all but universal in Spain during this whole period. The first
and the last of the House of Austria,—Charles the Fifth and the
feeblest of his descendants,—if alike in nothing else, were alike in
the zeal with which they sustained the Holy Office while they lived,
and with which, by their testaments, they commended it to the support
and veneration of their respective successors.<a id="FNanchor_267"
href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a> Nor did the intervening
kings show less deference to its authority. The first royal act of
Philip the Second, when he came from the Low Countries to assume the
crown of Spain, was to celebrate an <i>auto da fé</i> at Valladolid.<a
id="FNanchor_268" href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a>
When the young and gay daughter of Henry the Second of France arrived
at Toledo, in 1560, that city offered an <i>auto da fé</i> as part of the
rejoicings deemed appropriate to her wedding; and the same thing
was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[p. 206]</span> done by
Madrid, in 1632, for another French princess, when she gave birth
to an heir to the crown;<a id="FNanchor_269" href="#Footnote_269"
class="fnanchor">[269]</a>—odious proofs of the degree to which bigotry
had stifled both the dictates of an enlightened reason and the common
feelings of humanity.</p>

<p>But in all this the people and their leaders rejoiced. When a
nobleman, about to die for adherence to the Protestant faith, passed
the balcony where Philip the Second sat in state, and appealed to
him not to see his innocent subjects thus cruelly put to death,
the monarch replied, that, if it were his own son, he would gladly
carry the fagots for his execution; and the answer was received at
the time, and recorded afterwards, as one worthy of the head of the
mightiest empire in the world.<a id="FNanchor_270" href="#Footnote_270"
class="fnanchor">[270]</a> And again, in 1680, when Charles the Second
was induced to signify his desire to enjoy, with his young bride,
the spectacle of an <i>auto da fé</i>, the artisans of Madrid volunteered
in a body to erect the needful amphitheatre, and labored with such
enthusiasm, that they completed the vast structure in an incredibly
short space of time; cheering one another at their work with devout
exhortations, and declaring that, if the materials furnished them
should fail, they would pull down their own houses in order to obtain
what might be wanting to complete the holy task.<a id="FNanchor_271"
href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[p. 207]</span>Nor had the
principle of loyalty, always so prominent in the Spanish character,
become less perverted and mischievous than the religious principle.
It offered its sincere homage alike to the cold severity of Philip
the Second, to the weak bigotry of Philip the Third, to the luxurious
selfishness of Philip the Fourth, and to the miserable imbecility of
Charles the Second. The waste and profligacy of such royal favorites as
the Duke of Lerma and the Count Duke Olivares, which ended in national
bankruptcy and disgrace, failed seriously to affect the sentiments
of the people towards the person of the monarch, or to change their
persuasions that their earthly sovereign was to be addressed in
words and with feelings similar to those with which they approached
the Majesty of Heaven.<a id="FNanchor_272" href="#Footnote_272"
class="fnanchor">[272]</a> The king—merely because he was the king—was
looked upon substantially as he had been in the days of Saint Ferdinand
and the “Partidas,” when he was accounted the direct vicegerent of
Heaven, and the personal proprietor of all those portions of the
globe which he had inherited with his crown.<a id="FNanchor_273"
href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a> The Duc de Vendôme,
therefore, showed his thorough knowledge of the Spanish character,
when, in the War of the Succession,—Madrid being in possession of
the enemy, and every thing seeming to be lost,<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_208">[p. 208]</span>—he still declared, that, if the persons
of the king, the queen, and the prince were but safe, he would himself
answer for final success.<a id="FNanchor_274" href="#Footnote_274"
class="fnanchor">[274]</a> In fact, the old principle of loyalty, sunk
into a submission—voluntary, it is true, and not without grace, but
still an unhesitating submission—to the mere authority of the king,
seemed to have become the only efficient bond of connection between
the crown and its subjects, and the main resource of the state for
the preservation of social order. The nation ceased to claim its most
important rights, if they came in conflict with the rights claimed by
the royal prerogative; so that the resistance of Aragon in the case of
Perez, and that of Catalonia against the oppressive administration of
the Count Duke Olivares, were easily put down by the zeal of the very
descendants of the <i>Comuneros</i> of Castile.</p>

<p>It is this degradation of the loyalty and religion of the country,
infecting as it did every part of the national character, which we
have felt to be undermining the general culture of Spain during the
seventeenth century; its workings being sometimes visible on the
surface, and sometimes hidden by the vast and showy apparatus of
despotism and superstition under which it was often concealed even
from its victims. But it is a most melancholy fact in the case, that
whatever of Spanish literature survived at the end of this period
found its nourishment in such feelings of religion and loyalty
as still sustained the forms of the monarchy,—an imperfect and
unhealthy life, wasting away in an atmosphere of death. At last, as
we approach the conclusion of the century, the Inquisition and the
despotism seem to be everywhere present, and to have cast their<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[p. 209]</span> blight over every thing.
All the writers of the time yield to their influences, but none in
a manner more painful to witness, than Calderon and Solís; the two
whose names close up the period, and leave so little to hope for the
future. For the “Autos” of Calderon and the “History” of Solís were
undoubtedly regarded, both by their authors and by the public, as
works eminently religious in their nature; and the respect, and even
reverence, with which each of these great men treated the wretched
and imbecile Charles the Second, were as undoubtedly accounted to
them by their contemporaries for religious loyalty and patriotism. At
the present day, we cannot doubt that a literature which rests in any
considerable degree on such foundations must be near to its fall.<a

<p><span class="smcap">Charles</span> the Second was gathered to his
fathers on the first day of November, in the year 1700. How low he left
the intellectual culture of his country, and how completely the old
national literature had died out in his reign, we have already seen.
But, before there could be any serious thought of a revival from this
disastrous state of things, a civil war was destined to sweep over the
land, and still further exhaust its resources. Austria and France,
it had been long understood, would make pretensions to the throne of
Spain, so soon as it should be left vacant by the extinction of the
reigning dynasty; and the partisans of each of these great powers were
numerous and confident of success, not only in Spain, but throughout
Europe. At this moment, while<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[p.
214]</span> standing on the verge of the grave,—and knowing that he
stood there,—the last, unhappy descendant of the House of Austria, with
many misgivings and a heart-felt reluctance, finally announced his
preference; and, by a secret political testament, declared the Duke of
Anjou, second son of the Dauphin and grandson of Louis the Fourteenth
of France, to be sole heir to his throne and dominions.</p>

<p>The decision was not unexpected, and was, perhaps, as wise as a
wiser king would have made under similar circumstances. But it was
not the more likely, on either account, to be acquiesced in. Austria
declared war against the new dynasty, as soon as the will of the
deceased monarch was divulged; and England and Holland, outraged by the
bad faith of Louis the Fourteenth, who, hardly two years before, had
made an arrangement with them for a wholly different settlement of the
Spanish question, soon joined her. The war, known as “the War of the
Succession,” became general in its character; Spain was invaded by the
allied powers; and the contest for its throne was kept up on the soil
of that unfortunate country, partly by foreign troops, and partly by
divisions among its own people, until 1713, when the treaty of Utrecht
confirmed the claims of the Bourbon family, and gave peace to Europe,
wearied with blood.</p>

<p>As far as Spain was concerned, the results of this war were most
important. On the one hand, she lost by it nearly half of her European
dominions, and fell, if not in proportion to such a loss, yet very
greatly, in the scale of nations. But, on the other hand, the vast
resources of her American colonies still remained untouched; her
people had been roused to new energy by their exertions in defence
of their homes; and their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[p.
215]</span> ancient loyalty had been, to an extraordinary degree,
concentrated on a young and adventurous prince, who, though himself
a foreigner, stood before them as their defender against foreign
invasion. It seemed, therefore, as if still there were life in Spain,
and as if something remained of the old national character, on which
to build a new culture.<a id="FNanchor_276" href="#Footnote_276"
class="fnanchor">[276]</a></p>

<p>That Philip the Fifth should desire to restore the intellectual
dignity of the country, that had so generously adopted him, was
natural. But while the war lasted, it demanded all the care of his
government; and when it was over, and he turned himself to the task,
it was plain that, in his personal relations and dispositions, he was
but imperfectly fitted for it. Notwithstanding the sincerest efforts to
assimilate himself to the people he governed, he was still a foreigner,
little acquainted with their condition, and unable to sympathize with
their peculiar nationality. He had been educated at the court of Louis
the Fourteenth; the most brilliant court in Europe, and that in which,
more than in any other, letters were regarded as a part of the pageant
of empire. His character was not strongly marked; and he expressed
no decided love for any definite form of intellectual cultivation,
though he had good taste enough to enjoy the elegance to which he had
always been accustomed, and which had been an important part of his
breeding. He was, in fact, a Frenchman; and never could forget,—what
his grandfather had unwisely told him always to remember,—that he was
such. When, therefore, he desired to encourage elegant literature,
it was natural that he should first recur to the means by<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[p. 216]</span> which he had seen
it encouraged where, more than in any other country, it had been
successfully fostered by royal patronage; and if, in some respects, his
position was little favorable to such a use of his power, in one, at
least, it was eminently fortunate; for the earlier literature of Spain
had so nearly disappeared, that it could offer little resistance to any
attempt that might be made to introduce new forms or to infuse a new
character into the old.</p>

<p>At this moment, the idea of patronizing and controlling the
literature of a country by academies, established under the authority
of its government, and composed of the principal men of letters
of the time, was generally favored;—the French Academy, founded
by Cardinal Richelieu, and always the model of its class, being
now at the height of its success and fame. To establish a Spanish
Academy, which should have similar objects and reach similar results,
was, therefore, naturally the great literary project of the reign
of Philip the Fifth.<a id="FNanchor_277" href="#Footnote_277"
class="fnanchor">[277]</a> Probably the king himself had early
entertained it. Certainly it was formally brought to his notice, in
1713, by the Marquis of Villena, a nobleman, who, amidst the cares of
five successive viceroyalties, had found leisure to devote himself,
not only to letters, but to some of the more severe branches of
the physical and exact sciences. His first purpose seems to have
been, to form an academy whose empire should extend, on all sides,
to the limits of human knowledge, and whose subdivisions should be
substantially made according to the system of Lord Bacon. This,
however, was soon abandoned as too vast an undertaking; and it was
deter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[p. 217]</span>mined to
begin by confining the duties of the new association principally to
“the cultivation and establishment of the purity of the Castilian
language.” An Academy for this object went into operation, by virtue
of a royal decree dated the 3d of November, 1714.<a id="FNanchor_278"
href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a></p>

<p>As it was modelled almost exactly after the form of the French
Academy, the first project of its members was that of making a
Dictionary. The work was much needed. From the time of Fernando de
Herrera the language had not received large additions, but it had
received some that were of value. Mendoza and Coloma had introduced a
few military terms, that have since passed into common use; and both of
them, with Ercilla, Urrea, and many others, had been so familiar with
the Italian, as to seize some of its wealth for their own. Cervantes,
however, had, perhaps, done more than any body else. That he was
insensible neither to the danger of a too free intermixture of foreign
words, nor to the true principles that should govern their introduction
when needed, he has shown in the conversations of Don Quixote with
the printers at Barcelona, and with Sancho at the Duke’s castle; but
still he felt the rights of genius within him, and exercised them in
this respect as boldly as he did in most others. His new compounds,
his Latinisms, his restoration of old and neglected phrases, and his
occasional recourse to the Italian, have all been noted; and, in nearly
every instance, the words he adopted now enter into the recognized
vocabulary of the language. Other writers ventured in the same
direction, with less success; but still, from the glossaries added to
the poems of Blasco in 1584,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[p.
218]</span> and of Lopez Pinciano in 1605, there can be no doubt
that many words, which were then thought to need explanation, have
long since become familiar, and that the old Castilian stock,
during the reigns of Philip the Second and Philip the Third, was
receiving additions, which ought, in some way, to be recognized as
an important part of its permanent resources.<a id="FNanchor_279"
href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a></p>

<p>But, on the other hand, during the seventeenth century, the old
language had been much abused. From the appearance of Góngora no
proper regard had been paid to the preservation of its purity or of
its original characteristics, by many of the most popular authors that
employed it. The <i>Latiniparla</i>, as Quevedo called the affectation
of his time, had brought in many Latin words and many strange
phrases, wholly repugnant to the genius of the Spanish. Such words
and constructions, too, had enjoyed much favor; and Lope de Vega,
Calderon, and the other leading spirits, who pronounced them to be
affectations and refused directly to countenance them, yet occasionally
yielded to the fashion of their time, in order to obtain the applause
which was sure to follow.<a id="FNanchor_280" href="#Footnote_280"
class="fnanchor">[280]</a></p> <p><span class="pagenum"
id="Page_219">[p. 219]</span></p> <p>Both to receive the words that had
been rightfully naturalized in the language, and to place a mark of
disapprobation on those that were unworthy to be adopted, a Dictionary
resting on authority was wanted. None such had been attempted in
Spain. Indeed, during the whole of the preceding century, only one
Spanish Dictionary of any kind had been produced that received, or
deserved, the notice of the Academy. This was the work of Covarrubias,
whose “Tesoro,” first printed in 1611, is a curious book, full of
learning, and, in the etymological part, valuable, but often conceited,
and rarely showing philosophical acuteness in its definitions.<a
id="FNanchor_281" href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a> The
new Academy, therefore, could obtain little help from the labors of
their predecessors, and, for such as was worth having, were obliged
to go back to Lebrixa and his editors. But they were in earnest. They
labored diligently, and between 1726 and 1739 produced their grand
work, in six folio volumes. On the whole, it did them honor. No doubt,
it shows, in several parts, a want of mature consideration and good
judgment. Many words were omitted, that should have been inserted; many
were inserted, which were afterwards stricken out; and many were given
on unsatisfactory authorities. But its definitions are generally good;
its etymologies—though this part of the work was little regarded by its
authors—are respectable; and its citations are ample and pertinent.
In fact, all that had been done for the language, in the way of
dictionaries, since its origin, was not equal to what was now done in
this single work.</p>

<p>But the Academicians were not slow to perceive, that<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[p. 220]</span> a Dictionary so large
could exercise little popular influence. They began, therefore, soon
afterwards, to prepare an abridgment, in a single folio volume, for
more general use, and published the first edition of it in 1780. The
project was judicious, and its execution skilful. It omitted the
discussions, citations, and formal etymologies of the larger work;
but it established a better vocabulary, and improved many of the
old definitions. It had, therefore, from its first appearance, a
decided authority; and, by the persevering labors of the Academy, has
continued, in its successive editions, to be the proper standard of
the language,—labors which, since the latter part of the eighteenth
century, have been always heavy, and sometimes disagreeable, from the
constant tendency of even the better writers, like Melendez and his
school, to fall into Gallicisms, which the increasing intercourse with
France had rendered fashionable in the society of their time.</p>

<p>Another difficulty, however, soon presented itself to the Academy,
quite as serious as the size of their Dictionary. It was that of the
orthography they had adopted. The spelling of the Castilian—partly,
perhaps, from the very various elements of which it was composed, and
partly from the popular character of its literature—had always been
more unsettled than that of the other modern languages. Lebrixa, the
great scholar of the time of Ferdinand and Isabella, first attempted to
reduce it to order, and the simplicity of his system, which appeared in
1517, seemed at first likely to secure general favor and acceptance.
But thirty treatises, that at different times followed, had—with the
exception of the acute and pleasant one printed by Aleman when he was
in Mexico, in 1609—served<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[p.
221]</span> rather to unsettle and confuse the whole matter, than
to determine any thing in relation to it.<a id="FNanchor_282"
href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a></p>

<p>It is not surprising, therefore, that the first attempt of the
Academy, made in the form of a short discourse, prefixed to its larger
Dictionary, produced little effect. A separate work, which appeared in
1742, did something more, but not much; and the successive editions
of it which were called for by the public rather showed the uneasy
state of opinion in relation to the points under discussion, than any
thing else. At last, in 1815, the Academy, in the eighth recension of
its treatise on Orthography, and in 1817, in the fifth of its smaller
Dictionary, began a series of important changes, which have been
generally adopted by subsequent writers of authority, and appear to
have nearly settled the spelling of the Castilian, though still it
seems open to a few further modifications, and even to invite them.<a
id="FNanchor_283" href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a></p>

<p>A Grammar, like a Dictionary, was provided for in<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[p. 222]</span> the statutes of the
Academy. But the original members of that body, few of whom were men
of note and authority, showed a marked unwillingness to approach the
difficult discussions involved in such a work, and did not undertake
them at all till 1740. Even then, they went on slowly and with anxiety;
so that the result of their labors did not appear till 1771. For
this delay they were not wholly in fault. They had little to guide
them, except the rival Grammars of Gayoso and San Pedro, which were
published while the Academy was preparing its own, and the original
attempt of Lebrixa, which had long been forgotten. But, after so
protracted a labor, the Academicians should have produced something
more worthy of their claims; for what they gave to the world, at last,
was an unphilosophical and unpractical work, which, though subjected
to frequent revision since, is hardly an outline of what it ought to
be, and quite inferior to the Grammar of Salvá.<a id="FNanchor_284"
href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a></p>

<p>A History of the Castilian Language, and an Art of Poetry, which
were also expressly prescribed by the statutes of the Academy, have
never been prepared under their authority; but, instead of these tasks,
they have sometimes performed duties not originally imposed upon
them. Thus they have published careful editions<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_223">[p. 223]</span> of different works of recognized
authority, particularly a magnificent one of “Don Quixote,” in 1780-84.
Since 1777, they have, from time to time, offered prizes for poetical
compositions, though, as is usual in such cases, with less important
results than had been hoped. And occasionally they have printed, with
funds granted to them by the government, works deemed of sufficient
merit to deserve such patronage, and, among others, the excellent
treatise of Garcés on “The Vigor and Beauty of the Spanish Language,”
which appeared under their auspices in 1791.<a id="FNanchor_285"
href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a> During the whole
century, therefore, the Spanish Academy, occupied in these various
ways, continued to be a useful institution, carefully abstaining from
such claims to control the public taste as were at first made by its
model in France, and, though not always very active and efficient,
still never deserving the reproach of neglecting the duties and tasks
for which it was originally instituted.</p>

<p>One good effect that followed from the foundation of the Spanish
Academy was the establishment of other academies for kindred purposes.
These academies were entirely different from the social meetings,
under the same name, that were imitated from the Italian academies
in the time of Charles the Fifth,—one of the earliest of which was
held in the house of Cortés,<a id="FNanchor_286" href="#Footnote_286"
class="fnanchor">[286]</a> the conqueror of Mexico;—though still
the elder associations seem sometimes to have furnished materials,
out of which the institutions that succeeded them were constructed.
At least, this was the case with the Acade<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_224">[p. 224]</span>my of Barcelona, which has rendered
good service to the cause of letters since 1751, after having long
existed as an idle affectation, under the title of the “Academy of the
Diffident.” The only one, however, of any consequence to the general
literature of the country, was established during the reign of Philip
the Fifth,—the Academy for Spanish History, founded in 1738; the
character and amount of whose labors, both published and unpublished,
do its members much honor.<a id="FNanchor_287" href="#Footnote_287"
class="fnanchor">[287]</a></p>

<p>But such associations everywhere, though they may be useful and
even important in their proper relations, can neither create a new
literature for a country, nor, where the old literature is seriously
decayed, do much to revive it. The Spanish academies were no exceptions
to this remark. All elegant culture had so nearly disappeared before
the accession of the Bourbons, and there was such an insensibility to
its value in those classes of society where it should have been most
cherished, that it was plain the resuscitation must be the work of
time, and that the land must long lie fallow before another harvest
could be gathered in. During the entire reign of Philip the Fifth,
therefore,—a reign which, including the few months of his nominal
abdication in favor of his son, extends to forty-six years,—we shall
find undeniable traces of this unhappy state of things; few authors
appearing who deserve to be named at all, and still fewer who demand a
careful notice.</p>

<p>Poetry, indeed, or what passed under that name, continued to be
written; and some of it, though little en<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_225">[p. 225]</span>couraged by the general regard of the
nation, was printed. Moraes, a Portuguese gentleman of rank, who had
lived in Spain from his youth, wrote two heroic poems in Spanish; the
first on the discovery of “The New World,” which he published in 1701,
and the other on the foundation of the kingdom of Portugal, which was
printed in 1712; both appearing originally in an unfinished state, in
consequence of the author’s impatience for fame, and the earlier of
them still remaining so. But they have been long forgotten. Indeed, the
first, which is full of extravagant allegories, soon found the fate
which its author felt it deserved; and the other, though written with
great deference for the rules of art, and more than once reprinted, has
not at last enjoyed a better fortune.</p>

<p>The most amusing work of Moraes is a prose satire, printed in 1734,
called “The Caves of Salamanca,” where, in certain grottos, which a
popular tradition supposed to exist, sealed up by magic, within the
banks of the Tórmes, he finds Amadis of Gaul, Oriana, and Celestina,
and discourses with them and other fanciful personages on such subjects
as his humor happens to suggest. Parts of it are very wild; parts of it
are both amusing and wise, especially what is said about the Spanish
language and academies, and about the “Telemachus” of Fénelon, then
at the height of its fame. The whole shows few of the affectations
of style that still deformed and degraded whatever there was of
literature in the country, and which, though ridiculed in “The Caves
of Salamanca,” are abundant in the other works of the same author.<a
id="FNanchor_288" href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[p. 226]</span></p> <p>A long
heroic poem, in two parts, in honor of the conquest of Peru by the
Pizarros, was printed at Lima in 1732. It is founded principally on
the prose History of the Inca Garcilasso, but is rarely so interesting
as the gossip out of which it was constructed. The author, Pedro de
Barnuevo, was an officer of the Spanish government in South America;
and he gives in the Preface a long list of his works, published
and unpublished. He was, undoubtedly, a man of learning, but not a
poet. Like Moraes, he has arranged a mystical interpretation to his
story; some parts of which, such as that where America comes before
God, and prays to be conquered that she may be converted, are really
allegorical; while, in general, the interpretation he gives is merely
an after-thought, forced and unnatural. But his work is dull and in
bad taste, and the octave stanzas in which it is written are managed
with less skill than usual.<a id="FNanchor_289" href="#Footnote_289"
class="fnanchor">[289]</a></p>

<p>Several religious poems belong to the same period. One by Pedro de
Reynosa, printed in 1727, is on “Santa Casilda,” the converted daughter
of a Moorish king of Toledo, who figures in the history of Spain during
the eleventh century. Another, called “The Eloquence of Silence,” by
Miguel de Zevallos, in 1738, is devoted to the honor of Saint John of
Nepomuck, who, in the fourteenth century, was thrown into the Moldau,
by order of a king of Bohemia, because the holy man would<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[p. 227]</span> not reveal to the jealous
monarch what the queen had intrusted to him under the seal of the
confessional. Both are in the octave stanzas common to such poems, and
are full of the faults of their times. Two mock-heroic poems, that
naturally followed such attempts, are not better than the serious
poems which provoked them.<a id="FNanchor_290" href="#Footnote_290"
class="fnanchor">[290]</a></p>

<p>No account more favorable can be given of the lyric and
miscellaneous poetry of the period, than of the narrative. The best
that appeared, or at least what was thought to be the best at the time,
is to be found in the poetical works of Eugenio Lobo, first printed
in 1738. He was a soldier, who wrote verses only for his amusement;
but his friends, who admired them much beyond their merit, printed
portions of them, from time to time, until, at last, he himself thought
it better to permit a religious congregation to publish the whole in
a volume. They are very various in form, from fragments of two epics
down to sonnets, and equally various in tone, from that appropriate
to religious <i>villancicos</i> to that of the freest satire. But they are
in very bad taste; and, if any thing like poetry appears in them, it
is at rare intervals. Benegasi y Luxan, who, in 1743, published a
volume of such light verses as were called for by the gay society in
which he lived, wrote in a simpler style than Lobo, though, on the
whole, he succeeded no bet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[p.
228]</span>ter. But, except these two, and a few who imitated them,
such as Alvarez de Toledo and Antonio Muñoz, we have nothing from the
reign of the first of the Bourbons, that can claim notice in either
of the forms of poetry we have thus far examined.<a id="FNanchor_291"
href="#Footnote_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a></p>

<p>More characteristic than either, however, were two collections of
verse, written, as their titles profess, by the poets of most note at
the time, in honor of the king and queen, who, in 1722, meeting the
Host, as it was passing to a dying man, gave their own carriage to the
priest who bore it, and then, according to the fashion of the country,
followed reverently on foot. The names of Zamora the dramatist, of
Diego de Torres, well known for his various accomplishments in science
and letters, and of a few other poets, who are still remembered,
occur in the first collection; but, in general, the obscurity of
the authors who contributed to it is such as we might anticipate
from reading their poetry; while, at the same time, the occasion of
the whole shows how low was the culture which could attribute any
value to such publications.<a id="FNanchor_292" href="#Footnote_292"
class="fnanchor">[292]</a></p>

<p>A single bright spot in the poetical history of this period is only
the more remarkable from the gloom that surrounds it. It is a satire
attributed to Herbas, a person otherwise unknown, who disguised himself
un<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[p. 229]</span>der the name
of Jorge de Pitillas, and printed it in a literary journal. It was
singularly successful for the time when it appeared; a circumstance
the more to be noticed, as this success seems not to have inspired any
similar attempt, or even to have encouraged the author to venture again
before the public. The subject he chose was fortunate,—the bad writers
of his age,—and in discussing it he has spoken out boldly and manfully;
sometimes calling by name those whom he ridicules, and at other times
indicating them so that they cannot be mistaken. His chief merits are
the ease and simplicity of his style, the pungency and justness of his
satire, and his agreeable imitations of the old masters, especially
Persius and Juvenal, whom he further resembled in the commendable
qualities of brevity and sententiousness.<a id="FNanchor_293"

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">One</span> historical work of some consequence
belongs entirely to the reign of Philip the Fifth,—the commentaries on
the War of the Succession, and the history of the country from 1701 to
1725, by the Marquis of San Phelipe. Its author, a gentleman of Spanish
descent, was born in Sardinia, in the latter part of the seventeenth
century, and early filled several offices of consequence under the
government of Spain; but, when his native island was conquered by the
Austrian party, he remained faithful to the French family, under whom
he had thus far served, and made his escape to Madrid. There Philip
the Fifth received him with great favor. He was created Marquis of San
Phelipe,—a title chosen by himself in compliment to the king,—and,
besides being much employed during the war in military affairs, he was
sent afterwards as ambassador, first to Genoa, and then to the Hague,
where he died, on the 1st of July, 1726.</p>

<p>In his youth the Marquis of San Phelipe had been educated with
care, and therefore, during the active portions of his life, found
an agreeable resource in intellectual occupations. He wrote a poem
in octave stanzas on the story in the “Book of Tobit,” which was
printed in 1709, and a history of “The Hebrew Monarchy,” taken<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[p. 231]</span> from the Bible and
Josephus, which did not appear till 1727, the year after his death. But
his chief work was on the War of the Succession. The great interest he
took in the Bourbon cause induced him to write it, and the position he
had occupied in the affairs of his time gave him ample materials, quite
beyond the reach of others less favored. He called it “Commentaries
on the War of Spain, and History of its King, Philip the Fifth, the
Courageous, from the Beginning of his Reign to the Year 1725”; but,
although the compliment to his sovereign implied on the title-page
is faithfully carried through the whole narrative, the book was not
published without difficulty. The first volume, in folio, after being
printed at Madrid, was suppressed by order of the king, out of regard
to the honor of certain Spanish families that show to little advantage
in the troublesome times it records; so that the earliest complete
edition appeared at Genoa without date, but probably in 1729.</p>

<p>It is a spirited book, earnest in the cause of Castile against
Catalonia; but still, notwithstanding its partisan character, it is,
the most valuable of the contemporary accounts of the events to which
it relates; and, notwithstanding it has a good deal of the lively
air of the French memoirs, then so much in fashion, it is strongly
marked with the old Spanish feelings of religion and loyalty,—feelings
which this very book proves to have partly survived the general decay
of the national character during the seventeenth century, and the
convulsions that had shaken it at the opening of the eighteenth.
In style it is not perfectly pure. Perhaps tokens of its author’s
Sardinian education are seen in his choice of words; and certainly his
pointed epigrammatic phrases and sentences often show, that he leaned
to the rhetori<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[p. 232]</span>cal
doctrines of Gracian, of whom, in his narrative poem, we see that he
had once been a thorough disciple. But the Commentaries are, after
all, a pleasant book, and abound in details, given with much modesty
where their author is personally concerned, and with a picturesqueness
which belongs only to the narrative of one who has been an actor in
the scenes he describes.<a id="FNanchor_294" href="#Footnote_294"
class="fnanchor">[294]</a></p>

<p>But, when we speak of Spanish literature in the reign of Philip the
Fifth, we must never forget that the influence of France was gradually
becoming felt in all the culture of the country. The mass of the
people, it is true, either took no cognizance of the coming change, or
resisted it; and the new government willingly avoided whatever might
seem to offend or undervalue the old Castilian spirit. But Paris was
then, as it had long been, the most refined capital in Europe; and the
courts of Louis the Fourteenth and Louis the Fifteenth, necessarily
in intimate relations with that of Philip the Fifth, could not fail
to carry to Madrid a tone which was already spreading of itself into
Germany and the extreme North.</p>

<p>French, in fact, soon began to be spoken in the elegant society of
the capital and the court;—a thing before unknown in Spain, though
French princesses had more than once sat on the Spanish throne. But
now it was a compliment to the reigning monarch himself, and courtiers
strove to indulge in it. Pitillas, under pretence of laughing at
himself for following the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[p.
233]</span> fashion, ridicules the awkwardness of those who did so,
when he says,</p>

<div class="poem mt1"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">And French I talk; at least enough to know</p>

<p class="ti0 mt1">And Father Isla makes himself merry with the idea of
a man who fancies he has married an Andalusian or Castilian wife, and
finds out that she proves little better than a Frenchwoman after all.<a
id="FNanchor_295" href="#Footnote_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a></p>

<p>Translations from the French followed this state of things; and, at
last, an attempt was made to introduce formally into Spain a poetical
system founded on the critical doctrines prevalent in France. Its
author, Ignacio de Luzan, a gentleman of Aragon, was born in 1702; and,
while still a child, went to Italy and received a learned education in
the schools of Milan, Palermo, and Naples; remaining abroad eighteen
years, and enjoying the society of several of the most distinguished
Italian poets of the time, among whom were Maffei and Metastasio. At
last, in 1733, he returned to Spain, a well-bred scholar, according to
the ideas of scholarship then prevalent in Italy, and with a singular
facility in writing and speaking French and Italian.</p>

<p>His personal affairs and his native modesty kept him for some
time in retirement on the estates of his family in Aragon. But, in
the condition to which Spanish literature was then reduced, a man of
so many accomplishments could hardly fail, in any position, to make
his influence felt. That of Luzan soon became perceptible, because
he loved to write, and wrote a great deal.<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_234">[p. 234]</span> In Italy and Sicily he had published,
not only Italian poetry of his own, but French. In his native language
and at home, he naturally went further. He translated from Anacreon,
Sappho, and Musæus; he fitted dramas of Maffei, La Chaussée, and
Metastasio to the Spanish stage; and he wrote a considerable number
of short poems, and one original drama, “Virtue Honored,” which was
privately represented in Saragossa.</p>

<p>Whatever he did was well received, but little of it was published at
the time, and not much has appeared since. His “Odes on the Conquest of
Oran” were particularly admired by his friends, and, though somewhat
cold, may still be read with pleasure. These and other compositions
made him known to the government at Madrid, and procured for him, in
1747, the appointment of Secretary to the Spanish embassy at Paris.
There he remained three years, and, from the absence of the ambassador,
acted, for a large part of the time, as the only representative of his
country at the French court. On his return home, he continued to enjoy
the confidence of the king; and when he died suddenly, in 1754, he
was in great favor, and about to receive a place of more consequence
than any he had yet held.<a id="FNanchor_296" href="#Footnote_296"
class="fnanchor">[296]</a></p>

<p>The circumstances of the country, and those of his own education,
position, and tastes, opened to Luzan, as a critic, a career of almost
assured success. Every thing was so enfeebled and degraded, that it
could offer no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[p. 235]</span>
effectual resistance to what he might teach. The political importance
of his country among the nations of Europe had been crushed. Its moral
dignity was impaired. Its school of poetry had disappeared. The old
system of things in Spain, as far as poetical culture was concerned,
had passed away, no less than the Austrian dynasty, with which it
had come in; and no attempt deserving the name had yet been made to
determine what should be the intellectual character of the system that
should follow it. A small effort, under such circumstances, would go
far towards imparting a decisive movement; and, in literary taste and
criticism, Luzan was certainly well fitted to give the guiding impulse.
He had been educated with great thoroughness in the principles of the
classical French school, and he possessed all the learning necessary to
make known and support its peculiar doctrines. In 1728, he had offered
to the Academy at Palermo, of which he was a member, six critical
discussions on poetry, written in Italian; so that, when he returned
to Spain, he had only to take these papers and work them into a formal
treatise, suited to what he deemed the pressing wants of the country.
He did so;—and the result was his “Art of Poetry,” the first edition of
which appeared in 1737.</p>

<p>The attempt was by no means a new one. The rules and doctrines of
the ancients, in matters of taste and rhetoric, had frequently before
been announced and defended in Spain. Even Enzina, the oldest of those
who regarded Castilian poetry as an art, was not ignorant of Quintilian
and Cicero, though, in his short treatise, which shows more good sense
and good taste than can be claimed from the age, he takes substantially
the same view of his subject that the Marquis of Villena and the
Provençals had taken before him,—considering all<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_236">[p. 236]</span> poetry chiefly with reference to
its mechanical forms.<a id="FNanchor_297" href="#Footnote_297"
class="fnanchor">[297]</a> Rengifo, a teacher of grammar and rhetoric,
whose “Spanish Art of Poetry” dates from 1592, confines himself almost
entirely to the structure of the verse and the technical forms known
both to the elder Castilian style of composition and to the Italian
introduced by Boscan;—a curious discussion, in which the authority
of the ancients is by no means forgotten, but one whose chief value
consists in what it contains relating to the national school and
its peculiar measures.<a id="FNanchor_298" href="#Footnote_298"
class="fnanchor">[298]</a></p>

<p>Alonso Lopez, commonly called El Pinciano,—the same person who
wrote the dull epic on Pelayo,—went further, and in 1596 published
his “Ancient Poetical Philosophy,” in which, under the disguise of
a friendly correspondence, he gives, with much learning and some
acuteness, his own views of the opinions of the ancient masters
on all the modes of poetical composition.<a id="FNanchor_299"
href="#Footnote_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a> Cascales followed
him, in 1616, with a series of dialogues, somewhat more familiar than
the grave letters of Lopez, and resting more on the doctrines of
Horace, whose epistle to the Pisos he afterwards published, with a
well-written Latin commentary.<a id="FNanchor_300" href="#Footnote_300"
class="fnanchor">[300]</a> Salas, on the contrary, in his “New Idea
of Ancient Tragedy,” which appeared in 1633, followed Aristotle
rather than any other authority, and illustrated his discussion—which
is the ablest in Spanish literature on the side it sustains—by
a translation of the “Trojanæ” of Seneca,<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_237">[p. 237]</span> and an address of the theatre of all ages
to its various audiences.<a id="FNanchor_301" href="#Footnote_301"
class="fnanchor">[301]</a></p>

<p>All these works, however, and three or four others of less
consequence, assumed, so far as they attempted to lay their foundations
in philosophy, to be built on the rules laid down by Aristotle or
the Roman rhetoricians.<a id="FNanchor_302" href="#Footnote_302"
class="fnanchor">[302]</a> In this they committed a serious error.
Ancient rhetoric can be applied, in all its strictness, to no modern
poetry, and least of all to the poetry of Spain. The school of Lope
de Vega, therefore, passed over them like an irresistible flood,
leaving behind it hardly a trace of the structures that had been
raised to oppose its progress. But Luzan took a different ground.
His more immediate predecessors had been Gracian, who defended the
Gongorism of the preceding period, and Artiga, who, in a long treatise
“On Spanish Eloquence,” written in the ballad measures, had seemed
willing to encourage all the bad taste that prevailed in the beginning
of the eighteenth century.<a id="FNanchor_303" href="#Footnote_303"
class="fnanchor">[303]</a></p>

<p>Luzan took no notice of either of them. He followed the poetical
system of Boileau and Lebossu, not, indeed, forgetting the masters of
antiquity, but everywhere accommodating his doctrines to the demands
of modern poetry, as Muratori had done just before him, and enforcing
them by the example of the French school, then<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_238">[p. 238]</span> more admired than any other in Europe.<a
id="FNanchor_304" href="#Footnote_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a> His
object, as he afterwards explained it, was “to bring Spanish poetry
under the control of those precepts which are observed among polished
nations”; and his work is arranged with judgment to effect his purpose.
The first book treats of the origin and nature of poetry, and the
second, of the pleasure and advantage poetry brings with it. These two
books constitute one half of the work, and having gone through in them
what he thinks it necessary to say of the less important divisions of
the art,—such as lyric poetry, satire, and pastorals,—he devotes the
two remaining books entirely to a discussion of the drama and of epic
poetry,—the forms in which Spanish genius had long been more ambitious
of excellence than in any other. A strict method reigns through
the whole; and the style, if less rich than is found in the older
prose-writers, and less so than the genius of the language demands, is
clear, simple, and effective. In explaining and defending his system
of opinions, he shows judgment, and a temperate philosophy; and his
abundant illustrations, drawn not only from the Castilian, the French,
the Greek, and the Latin, but from the Italian and the Portuguese, are
selected with excellent taste, and applied skilfully to strengthen his
general argument and design. For its purpose, a better treatise could
hardly have been produced.</p>

<p>The effect was immediate and great. It seemed to offer a remedy
for the bad taste which had accompanied, and in no small degree
hastened, the decline of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[p.
239]</span> national literature from the time of Góngora. It was
seized on, therefore, with eagerness, as the book that was wanted;
and when to this we add that the literature of the age of Louis the
Fourteenth, which it held up as the model literature of Christendom,
was then regarded throughout Europe with almost unmingled admiration,
we shall not be surprised that the “Poética” of Luzan exercised,
from its first appearance, a controlling authority over opinion at
the court of Spain, and over the few writers of reputation then to
be found in the country.<a id="FNanchor_305" href="#Footnote_305"
class="fnanchor">[305]</a></p>

<p>Something more, however, than a reformation in taste was wanted in
Spain before a sufficient foundation could be laid for advancement
in elegant literature. The commonest forms of truth had been so long
excluded from the country, that the human mind there seemed to have
pined away, and to have become dwarfed, for want of its appropriate
nourishment. All the great sciences, both moral and physical, that had
been for a hundred years advancing with an accelerated speed everywhere
else throughout Europe, had been unable to force their way through the
jealous guard which ecclesiastical and political despotism had joined
to keep for ever watching the passes of the Pyrenees. From the days of
the <i>Comuneros</i> and the Reformation of Luther, when religious sects
began to discuss the authority of princes and the<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_240">[p. 240]</span> rights of the people, and when the
punishment of opinion became the settled policy of the Spanish state,
every thing in the shape of instruction that was not approved by the
Church was treated as dangerous. At the universities, which from their
foundation had been entirely ecclesiastical corporations, and were used
constantly to build up ecclesiastical influences, no elegant learning
was fostered, and very little tolerated, except such as furnished means
to form scholastic Churchmen and faithful Catholics; the physical and
exact sciences were carefully excluded and forbidden, except so far as
they could be taught on the authority of Aristotle; and, as Jovellanos
said boldly in a memorial on the subject to Charles the Fourth,
“even medicine and jurisprudence would have been neglected, if the
instincts of men had permitted them to forget the means by which life
and property are protected.”<a id="FNanchor_306" href="#Footnote_306"
class="fnanchor">[306]</a></p>

<p>The Spanish universities, in fact, still taught from the same books
they had used in the time of Cardinal Ximenes, and by the same methods.
The scholastic philosophy was still regarded as the highest form of
merely intellectual culture. Diego de Torres, afterwards distinguished
for his knowledge in the physical sciences,—a man born and educated at
Salamanca in the first half of the century,—says, that, after he had
been five years in one of the schools of the University there, it was
by accident he learned the existence of the mathematical sciences.<a
id="FNanchor_307" href="#Footnote_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a>
And, fifty years later, Blanco White declares, that, like most of his
countrymen, he should have completed his studies in theology at the
University of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[p. 241]</span>
Seville without so much as hearing of elegant literature, if he had
not chanced to make the acquaintance of a person who introduced
him to a partial knowledge of Spanish poetry.<a id="FNanchor_308"
href="#Footnote_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a></p>

<p>Thus far, therefore, the old system of things was triumphant, and
the common forms of advancing knowledge were, to an extraordinary
and almost incredible degree, kept out of the country. On the other
hand, errors, follies, and absurdities sprang up and abounded, just
as surely as darkness follows the exclusion of light. Few persons in
Spain in the beginning of the eighteenth century were so well informed
as not to believe in astrology, and fewer still doubted the disastrous
influence of comets and eclipses. The system of Copernicus was not
only discouraged, but forbidden to be taught, on the ground that it
was contrary to Scripture. The philosophy of Bacon, with all the
consequences that had followed it, was unknown. It was not, perhaps,
true, that the healing waters of knowledge had been rolled backward
to their fountain, but no spirit of power had descended to trouble
them, and they had now been kept stagnant till life was no longer in
them and life could no longer be supported by them. It seemed as if
the faculties of thinking and reasoning, in the better sense of these
words, were either about to be entirely lost in Spain, or to be partly
preserved only in a few scattered individuals, who, by the civil and
ecclesiastical tyranny that oppressed them, would be prevented from
diffusing even the imperfect light which they themselves enjoyed.</p>

<p>But it could not be so. The human mind cannot be permanently
imprisoned; and it is an obvious proof of this consoling fact, that the
intellectual emancipation of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[p.
242]</span> Spain was begun by a man of no extraordinary gifts, and one
whose position gave him no extraordinary advantages for the undertaking
to which he devoted his life,—the quiet monk, Benito Feyjoó. He was
born in 1676, the eldest son of respectable parents in the northwestern
part of Spain, who, contrary to the opinions of their time, did not
think the law of primogeniture required them to devote their first-born
wholly to the duty of sustaining the honors of his family and enjoying
the income of the estates he was to inherit. At the age of fourteen,
his destination to the Church was determined upon; but he loved study
of all kinds, and applied himself, not only to theology, but to the
physical sciences and to medicine, so far as means were allowed him in
the low state to which all intellectual culture was then sunk. As early
as 1717, he established himself in a Benedictine convent at Oviedo, and
lived there forty-seven years in as strict a retirement as his duties
permitted, occupied only with his studies, and relying almost entirely
on the press as the means of enlightening his countrymen.</p>

<p>His personal character and resources, in some respects, fitted him
well for the great task he had undertaken. He was a sincere Catholic,
and therefore felt no disposition to interfere even with abuses
that were protected by the authority of his Church; a circumstance
without which he would have been stopped at the very threshold of his
enterprise. His mind was strong and patient of labor; and if, on the
one hand, his researches were restrained by the embarrassments of his
ecclesiastical position, he had, on the other, obtained, what few
Spaniards then enjoyed, the means of knowing much of what had been
done in Italy, in France, and even in England, for the advancement
of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[p. 243]</span> science during
the century preceding that in which he was educated. Above all, he was
honest, and seriously devoted to his work. But, as he advanced, he was
shocked to find how wide a gulf separated his own country from the
rest of Europe. Truth, he saw, had, on many important subjects, been
so completely excluded from Spain, that its very existence was hardly
suspected; and that, while Cervantes and Lope de Vega, Calderon and
Quevedo, had been rioting unrestrained in the world of imagination, the
solemn world of reality,—the world of moral and physical truth,—had
been as much closed against inquiry as if his country had been no part
of civilized Europe.</p>

<p>At times he seems to have been anxious concerning the result of his
labors; but, on the whole, his courage did not fail him. He was not,
indeed, a man of genius. He was not a man to invent new systems of
metaphysics or philosophy. But he was a learned man, with a cautious
judgment, somewhat obscured, but not really impaired, by religious
prejudices, from which he could not be expected to emancipate himself;
he was a man who understood the real importance of the labors of
Galileo, Bacon, and Newton, of Leibnitz, Pascal, and Gassendi; and,
what was of vastly more consequence, he was determined that his own
countrymen should no longer remain ignorant of the advancement already
made by the rest of Christendom under the influence of master-spirits
like these.</p>

<p>So far as the War of the Succession had served to rouse the national
character from its lethargy, and to direct the thoughts of Spaniards
to what had been done beyond the Pyrenees, it was favorable to his
purpose. But in other respects, as we have seen, it had effected
nothing for the national culture. Still, when, in 1726,<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[p. 244]</span> Feyjoó printed a volume
of essays connected with his main purpose, he was able to command
public attention, and was encouraged to go on. He called it “The
Critical Theatre”; and in its different dissertations,—as separate as
the papers in “The Spectator,” but longer and on graver subjects,—he
boldly attacked the dialectics and metaphysics then taught everywhere
in Spain; maintained Bacon’s system of induction in the physical
sciences; ridiculed the general opinion in relation to comets,
eclipses, and the arts of magic and divination; laid down rules for
historical faith, which would exclude most of the early traditions of
the country; showed a greater deference for woman, and claimed for her
a higher place in society, than the influence of the Spanish Church
willingly permitted her to occupy; and, in all respects, came forth
to his countrymen as one urging earnestly the pursuit of truth and
the improvement of social life. Eight volumes of this stirring work
were published before 1739, and then it stopped, without any apparent
reason. But in 1742 Feyjoó began a similar series of discussions, under
the name of “Learned and Inquiring Letters,” which he finished in 1760,
with the fifth volume, thus closing up the long series of his truly
philanthropical, as well as philosophical, labors.</p>

<p>Of course he was assailed. A work, called the “Antiteatro Crítico,”
appeared early, and was soon followed by another, with nearly the
same title, and by not a few scattered tracts and volumes, directed
against different portions of what he had published. But he was quite
able to defend himself. He wrote with clearness and good taste in an
age when the prevailing style was obscure and affected; and, if he
fell occasionally into Gallicisms, from relying much on French writers
for his materials, his mistakes of this sort were rare; and, in<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[p. 245]</span> general, he presented
himself in a Castilian costume, that was respectable and attractive.
Nor was he without wit, which his prudence taught him to use sparingly,
and he had always the energy which belongs to good sense and practical
wisdom; a union of qualities not often found anywhere, and certainly of
most rare occurrence in cloisters like those in which Feyjoó passed his
long life.</p>

<p>The attacks made on him, therefore, served chiefly to draw to his
works the attention he solicited, and in the end advanced his cause,
instead of retarding it. Even the Inquisition, to which he was more
than once denounced, summoned him in vain before its tribunals.<a
id="FNanchor_309" href="#Footnote_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a>
His faith could not be questioned, and his cause was stronger than
they were. Fifteen editions of his principal work, large as it was,
were printed in half a century. The excitement it produced went on
increasing as long as he lived; and when he died, in 1764, he could
look back and see that he had imparted a movement to the human mind
in Spain, which, though it was far from raising Spanish philosophy
to a level with that of France and England, had yet given it a right
direction, and done more for the intellectual life of his country than
had been done for a century.<a id="FNanchor_310" href="#Footnote_310"

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> can hardly be said, that, during the
forty-six years of the reign of Philip the Fifth, the intolerance
which had so long blighted the land relaxed its grasp. The progress of
knowledge might, indeed, be gradually and silently accumulating means
to resist it, but its power was still unbroken, and its activity as
formidable as ever. Louis the Fourteenth, in whom an old age of bigotry
naturally ended a life of selfish indulgence, had counselled his
grandson to sustain the Inquisition, as one of the means for insuring
tranquillity to the political government of the country; and this
advice, not given without a knowledge of the Spanish character, was, on
the whole, acted upon with success, if not with entire consistency.</p>

<p>At first, indeed, the personal dispositions of the king in relation
to this mighty engine of state seemed somewhat unsettled. When it was
proposed to him to celebrate an <i>auto da fé</i>, as a part of the pageant
suitable to the coming in of a new dynasty, the young monarch, fresh
from the elegance of the court of Versailles, refused to sanction
its barbarities by his presence. Even later he encouraged Macanaz,
a person high in office, to publish a work in defence of the crown
against the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[p. 247]</span>
overgrown pretensions of the Church, and at one time he went so
far as to entertain a project for suspending the Holy Office, or
suppressing it altogether.<a id="FNanchor_311" href="#Footnote_311"
class="fnanchor">[311]</a></p>

<p>But these dispositions were transient. The Spanish priesthood early
obtained control of the king’s mind. In one of the sieges of Barcelona,
during the War of the Succession, he was induced to consult an image
of the Virgin, and to avow afterwards, very solemnly, that she had
given him a miraculous promise of the fidelity of the Catalonians,—a
promise, it should be added, such as would be likely to insure its own
fulfilment. The death of the queen, in 1714, which plunged him into a
deep melancholy, further contributed to give power to the clergy who
surrounded him; and, a year afterwards, when the Inquisition took firm
ground against Macanaz and the royal prerogative, the king yielded,
and Macanaz fled to France. And finally, when, in 1724, after a few
months of abdication, Philip resumed the reins of government, which he
should never have laid down, no small part of the increased energy,
with which he fulfilled the duties of his high place, was inspired by
the influence of the Church. As he grew older, he grew more bigoted;
and in his last years, when the accumulated power placed in his hands
by the destruction of the few remaining privileges of Aragon and
Catalonia had made him a more absolute monarch than ever before sat
on the Spanish throne, he seemed to rejoice, as much as any of his
predecessors, in devoting the whole of his prerogatives to advance the
interests of the priesthood.<a id="FNanchor_312" href="#Footnote_312"
class="fnanchor">[312]</a></p>

<p>But, from first to last, there was no real relaxation in<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[p. 248]</span> the intolerance of the
Church. The fires of the Inquisition had burnt as if Philip the Second
were on the throne. At least one <i>auto da fé</i> was celebrated annually
in each of the seventeen tribunals into which the country was divided;
so that the entire number of these atrocious popular exhibitions of
bigotry during the reign of Philip the Fifth exceeded seven hundred and
eighty. How many persons were burnt alive in them is not exactly known;
but it is believed, that there were more than a thousand, and that at
least twelve times that number were, in different ways, subjected to
public punishments and disgrace. Judaism, which had penetrated anew
into Spain, from the period of the conquest of Portugal, was the great
crime, to be hunted down with all the ingenuity of persecution; and
undoubtedly all that could be found of the Hebrew nation or faith
was now for the second time extirpated, as nearly as it is possible
to extirpate what conscience refuses to give up, and fear and hatred
have so many ways to hide. But some men of letters—like Belando, who
wrote a civil history of part of the reign of Philip the Fifth, which
he dedicated to that monarch, and which bore on its pages all the
regular permissions to be printed—were punished without the pretence
of being guilty of heresy or unbelief; and many more disappeared from
society, who, like Macanaz, were known to entertain political opinions
offensive to the Church or the government, but of whom nothing else
was known that could render them obnoxious to censure. On the whole,
therefore, down to the death of Philip the Fifth, the old alliance
between the government of the state and the power of the Church—an
alliance supported by the general assent of the people—must still be
assumed to have continued unbroken, and its authority must still<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[p. 249]</span> be felt to have been
sufficient to control all freedom of discussion, and effectually to
check and silence such intellectual activity as it deemed dangerous.<a
id="FNanchor_313" href="#Footnote_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a></p>

<p>In the reign of Ferdinand the Sixth, which lasted thirteen years,
and ended in 1759, there is evidently an improvement in this state of
things. The seeds sown in the time of his father, if less cared for and
cultivated than they should have been, were beginning to germinate and
disencumber themselves from the cold and hard soil into which they had
been cast. Foreign intercourse, especially that with France, brought in
new ideas. Ferreras, the careful, but dull, annalist of his country’s
history; Juan de Yriarte, the active head of the Royal Library; Bayer,
his learned successor; Mayans, who had a passion for collecting and
editing books; and, above all, the wise and modest Father Feyjoó, had
not labored in vain, and still survived to see the results of their
toils.</p>

<p>The Church itself began slowly to acknowledge the irresistible power
of advancing intelligence, and the Inquisition, without acknowledging
it, felt its influence. Not more than ten persons were burnt alive
in the time of Ferdinand the Sixth, and these were obscure relapsed
Jews;—men whose fate is as heavy a reproach to the Inquisition as if
they had been more intelligent and distinguished, but the example of
whose punishment did not strike a terror such as that of the dying
Protestants and patriots of Aragon had once done.<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_250">[p. 250]</span> The persecutions of the Holy Office, in
fact, not only grew less frequent and cruel, but became more than ever
subservient to the political authority of the country, and were now
chiefly exercised in relation to Freemasonry, which was known at this
period in Spain for the first time, and caused much uneasiness to the
government. But the policy of the state, during the reign of Ferdinand
the Sixth, was in the main peaceful and healing. Efforts, not without
success, were made to collect materials for a history of the country
from the earliest times. Spaniards were sent abroad to be educated
at the public expense, and foreigners were encouraged to establish
themselves in Spain, and to diffuse the knowledge they had acquired
in their own more favored homes. Every thing, in short, indicated a
spirit of change, if it did not give proof of much absolute progress.<a

<p>The direction of the literature of the country, however, was the
same it had taken from the beginning of the century. Slight, but
unsatisfactory, attempts continued to be made to adhere to the forms
of the elder time;—such attempts as are to be seen in a long narrative
poem by the Count Saldueña on the subject of Pelayo, and two very
poor imitations of the “Para Todos” of Montalvan, one of which was by
Moraleja, and the other by Ortiz. But the amount of what was undertaken
in this way was very small, and the impulse was constantly diminishing;
for the French school enjoyed now all the favor that was given to any
form of elegant literature.<a id="FNanchor_315" href="#Footnote_315"
class="fnanchor">[315]</a></p> <p><span class="pagenum"
id="Page_251">[p. 251]</span></p> <p>In this respect, a fashionable
society, called The Academy of Good Taste, and connected with the
court of Madrid, exercised some influence. It dates from 1749, and was
intended, perhaps, to resemble those French <i>coteries</i>, which began
in the reign of Louis the Thirteenth, at the Hotel de Rambouillet,
and were long so important both in the literary and political history
of France. The Countess of Lemos, at whose house it met, was its
founder, and it gradually ranked among its members several of the more
cultivated nobility and most of the leading men of letters, such as
Luzan, Montiano, Blas Nasarre, and Velazquez, each of whom was known,
either at that time or soon afterwards, by his published works.<a
id="FNanchor_316" href="#Footnote_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a></p>

<p>Except Luzan, of whom we have already spoken, Velazquez was the
most distinguished of their number. He was descended from an old and
noble family, in the South of Spain, and was born in 1722; but, from
his position in society, he passed most of his life at court. There he
became involved in the political troubles of the reign of Charles the
Third, in consequence of which he suffered a long imprisonment from
1766 to 1772, and died of apoplexy the same year he was released.</p>

<p>Velazquez was a man of talent and industry, rather than a man of
genius. He was a member, not only of the principal Spanish academies,
but of the French Academy of Inscriptions and Belles Lettres, and wrote
several works of learning relating to the literature and antiquities
of his country. The only one of them now<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_252">[p. 252]</span> much valued was published in 1754, under
the title of “Sources of Castilian Poetry,” of which it is, in fact,
a history, coming down to his own times, or near to them. It is a
slight work, confused in its arrangement, and too short to develope
its subject satisfactorily; but it is written in a good style, and
occasionally shows acuteness in its criticism of individual authors.
Its chief fault is, that it is devoted to the French school, and is
an attempt to carry out, by means of an historical discussion, the
doctrines laid down nearly twenty years before by Luzan, in his theory
of poetical composition.<a id="FNanchor_317" href="#Footnote_317"
class="fnanchor">[317]</a></p>

<p>Mayans, a Valencian gentleman of learning, and another of those who
had a considerable influence on Spanish literature at this period,
followed a similar course in his “Retórica,” which appeared in 1757,
and is founded rather on the philosophical opinions of the Roman
rhetoricians than on the modification of those opinions by Boileau
and his followers. It is a long and very cumbrous work, less fitted
to the wants of the times than that of Luzan, and even more opposed
to the old Castilian spirit, which submitted so unwillingly to rules
of any sort. But it is a storehouse of curious extracts from authors
belonging to the best period of Spanish literature, almost always
selected with good judgment, if not always skilfully applied to the
matter under discussion.<a id="FNanchor_318" href="#Footnote_318"
class="fnanchor">[318]</a></p>

<p>To these works of Mayans, Velazquez, and Luzan<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_253">[p. 253]</span> should be added the Preface by Nasarre
to the plays of Cervantes, in 1749, where an attempt is made to
take the authority of his great name from the school that prevailed
in his time, by showing that these unsuccessful efforts of the
author of “Don Quixote” were only caricatures ridiculing Lope de
Vega; not dramatic compositions intended for serious success in the
extravagant career which Lope’s versatile genius had opened to his
contemporaries. But this attempt was a failure, and was only one of a
long series of efforts made to discountenance the old theatre, that
must be noticed hereafter.<a id="FNanchor_319" href="#Footnote_319"

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> reign of Ferdinand the Sixth, which
had been marked with little political energy during its continuance,
was saddened, at its close, by the death of the monarch from grief
at the loss of his queen. But it had not been without beneficial
influences on the country. A wise economy had been introduced, for the
first time since the discovery of America, into the administration
of the state; the abused powers of the Church had been diminished
by a <i>concordat</i> with the Pope; the progress of knowledge had been
furthered; and Father Feyjoó, vigorous, though old, was still
permitted, if not encouraged, to go on with his great task, and create
a school that should rest on the broad principles of philosophy
recognized in England and in France.</p>

<p>We must not, however, be misled by such general statements.
Spain, notwithstanding half a century of advancement, was still
deplorably behind the other countries of Western Europe in that
intellectual cultivation, without which no nation in modern times can
be prosperous, strong, or honored. “There is not,” says the Marquis of
Enseñada, in a report made to the king, as minister of state,—“there
is not a professorship<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[p.
255]</span> of public law, of experimental science, of anatomy, or
of botany, in the kingdom. We have no exact geographical maps of
the country or its provinces, nor any body who can make them; so
that we depend on the very imperfect maps we receive from France
and Holland, and are shamefully ignorant of the true relations and
distances of our own towns.”<a id="FNanchor_320" href="#Footnote_320"
class="fnanchor">[320]</a></p>

<p>Under these circumstances, the accession of a prince like Charles
the Third was eminently fortunate for the country. He was a man of
energy and discernment, a Spaniard by birth and character, but one whom
political connections had placed early on the throne of Naples, where,
during a reign of twenty-four years, he had done much to restore the
dignity of a decayed monarchy, and had learned much of the condition
of Europe outside of the Pyrenees. When, therefore, the death of his
half-brother called him to the throne of Spain, he came with a kind and
degree of experience in affairs which fitted him well for his duties
in the more important and more unfortunate kingdom, whose destinies he
was to control for above a quarter of a century. Happily, he seems to
have comprehended his position from the first, and to have understood
that he was called to a great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[p.
256]</span> work of reform and regeneration, where his chief contest
was to be with ecclesiastical abuses.</p>

<p>In some respects he was successful. His ministers, Roda,
Florida-Blanca, Aranda, and Campomanes, were men of ability. By their
suggestions and assistance, he abridged the Papal power so far, that
no rescript or edict from Rome could have force in Spain without the
expressed assent of the throne; he restrained the Inquisition from
exercising any authority whatever, except in cases of obstinate heresy
or apostasy; he forbade the condemnation of any book, till its author,
or those interested in it, had had an opportunity to be heard in its
defence; and, finally, deeming the Jesuits the most active opponents of
the reforms he endeavoured to introduce, he, in one day, expelled their
whole body from his dominions all over the world, breaking up their
schools and confiscating their great revenues.<a id="FNanchor_321"
href="#Footnote_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a> At the same time, he
caused improved plans of study to be suggested; he made arrangements
for popular education, such as were before unknown in Spain; and he
raised the tone of instruction and the modes of teaching in the few
higher institutions over which he could lawfully extend his control.</p>

<p>But many abuses were beyond his reach. When he appealed to the
Universities, urging them to change their ancient habits, and teach
the truths of the physical and exact sciences, Salamanca answered,
in 1771, “Newton teaches nothing that would make a good logician or
metaphysician, and Gassendi and Descartes do not agree so well with
revealed truth as Aristotle does.” And the other Universities showed
little more of the spirit of advancement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[p. 257]</span>With the
Inquisition his success was far from being complete. His authority
was resisted, as far as resistance was possible; but the progress of
intelligence made all bigotry every year less active and formidable;
and, whether it be an honor to his reign, or whether it be a disgrace,
it is to be recorded, that the last person who perished at the stake
in Spain, by ecclesiastical authority, was an unfortunate woman, who
was burnt at Seville for witchcraft in 1781.<a id="FNanchor_322"
href="#Footnote_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a></p>

<p>Under the influence of a spirit like that of Charles the Third,
during a reign protracted to twenty-nine years, there was a new and
considerable advancement in whatever tends to make life desirable, of
which the country on all sides gave token. The population, which had
fled or died away, seemed to spring up afresh in places that oppression
had made desert, and having regained something under the first of the
Bourbons, it now, under the third, recovered rapidly the numbers it had
lost in the days of the House of Austria, by wars all over the world,
by emigration, by the persecution of the Jews and the expulsion of the
Moriscos, by bad legislation, and by the cruel spirit of religious
intolerance. The revenues in the same period were increased threefold,
without adding to the burdens of the people; and the country seemed to
be brought from a state of absolute bankruptcy to one of comparative
ease and prosperity. It was certain, therefore, that Spain was not
falling to ruin, as it had been in the time of Charles the Second.<a
id="FNanchor_323" href="#Footnote_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[p. 258]</span></p> <p>But all
intellectual cultivation is slow of growth, and all intellectual reform
still slower. The life and health infused into the country were, no
doubt, felt in every part of its physical system, reviving and renewing
the powers that had been so long wasted away, and that at one period
had seemed near to speedy dissolution. But it was obvious, that much
time must still elapse before such healthful circulations could reach
the national culture generally, and a still longer time before they
could revive that elegant literature, which is the bright, consummate
flower of all true civilization. Yet life was beginning to be seen. It
was a dawn, if it was nothing more.</p>

<p>The first striking effect produced by this movement in the reigns
of Ferdinand the Sixth and Charles the Third was one quite in sympathy
with the spirit of the nation, then resisting the ecclesiastical
abuses that had so long oppressed it. It was an attack on the style
of popular preaching, which, originally corrupted by Paravicino, the
distinguished follower of Góngora, had been constantly falling lower
and lower, until, at last, it seemed to have reached the lowest point
of degradation and vulgarity. The assailant was Father Isla, who was
born in 1703 and died in 1781, at Bologna, where, being a Jesuit,
he had retired, on the general expulsion of his Order from Spain.<a
id="FNanchor_324" href="#Footnote_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a> His
earliest published work is his “Triumph of Youth,” printed in 1727,
to give the nation an account of a festival, celebrated that year
during eleven days at Salamanca, in honor of two very youthful saints
who had been Jesuits, and who had just been canonized by Benedict
the Thirteenth; a gay tract, full of poems, farces, and accounts of
the maskings and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[p. 259]</span>
bull-fights to which the occasion had given rise, and coming as near
as possible to open satire of the whole matter, but yet with great
adroitness avoiding it.</p>

<p>In a work somewhat similar, he afterwards went further. It was
a description of the proclamation made in 1746, at Pamplona, on
the accession of Ferdinand the Sixth, which was attended with such
extravagant and idle ceremonies, that, being required to give some
account of them to the public, he could not refrain from indulging in
his love of ridicule. But he did it with a satire so delicate and so
crafty, that those who were its subjects failed at first to apprehend
his real purpose. On the contrary, the Council of the proud capital
of Navarre thanked him for the honor he had done them; the Bishop
and Archbishop complimented him for it; several persons whom he had
particularly noticed sent him presents; and, when the irony began
to be suspected, it became a subject of public controversy, as in
the case of De Foe’s “Shortest Way with the Dissenters,” whether the
praise bestowed were in jest or in earnest;—Isla all the time defending
himself with admirable ingenuity and wit, as if he were personally
aggrieved at the unfavorable construction put upon his compliments.
The discussion ended with his retreat or exile from Pamplona.<a
id="FNanchor_325" href="#Footnote_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a></p>

<p>He was, however, at this period of his life occupied with more
serious duties, and soon found among them a higher mark for his wit.
From the age of twenty-four he had been a successful preacher, and
continued such until he was cruelly expelled from his own country. But
he perceived how little worthy of its great subjects was the prevalent
style of Spanish pulpit ora<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[p.
260]</span>tory,—how much it was degraded by bad taste, by tricks of
composition, by conceits and puns, and even by a low buffoonery, in
which the vulgar monks, sent to preach in the churches or in the public
streets and squares, indulged themselves merely to win applause from
equally vulgar audiences, and increase the contributions they solicited
by arts so discreditable. It is said that at first Father Isla was
swept away by the current of his times, which ran with extraordinary
force, and that he wrote, in some degree, as others did. But he soon
recognized his mistake, and his numerous published sermons, written
between 1729 and 1754, are marked with a purity and directness of style
which had long been unknown, and which, though wanting the richness
and fervor of the exhortations of Luis de Leon and Luis de Granada,
would not have dishonored the Spanish pulpit even in their days.<a
id="FNanchor_326" href="#Footnote_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a></p>

<p>Isla, however, was not satisfied with merely setting a good example.
He determined to make a direct attack on the abuse itself. For this
purpose, he wrote what he called “The History of the Famous Preacher,
Friar Gerund”; a satirical romance, in which he describes the life of
one of these popular orators, from his birth in an obscure village,
through his education in a fashionable convent, and his adventures
as a missionary about the country; the fiction ending abruptly with
his preparation to deliver a course of sermons in a city that seems
intended to represent Madrid. It is written throughout with great
spirit; and not only are the national manners and character everywhere
present, but, in the episodes and in the occasional sketches Isla<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[p. 261]</span> has given of conventual
and religious life in his time, there is an air of reality which leaves
no doubt that the author drew freely on the resources of his personal
experience. Its plan resembles slightly that of “Don Quixote,” but
its execution reminds us oftener of Rabelais and his discursive and
redundant reflections, though of Rabelais without his coarseness.
It is serious, as becomes the Spanish character, and conceals under
its gravity a spirit of sarcasm, which, in other countries, seems
inconsistent with the idea of dignity, but which, in Spain, has been
more than once happily united with it, and made more effective by the
union.</p>

<p>The sketches of character and specimens of fashionable pulpit
oratory given in the “Friar Gerund” are the best parts of it, and are
agreeable illustrations for the literary history of the eighteenth
century. Of the preacher whom the Friar took for his model we have the
following carefully drawn portrait:—</p>

<p>“He was in the full perfection of his strength, just about
three-and-thirty years old; tall, robust, and stout; his limbs well set
and well proportioned; manly in gait, inclining to corpulence, with an
erect carriage of his head, and the circle of hair round his tonsure
studiously and exactly combed and shaven. His clerical dress was always
neat, and fell round his person in ample and regular folds. His shoes
fitted him with the greatest nicety, and, above all, his silken cap
was adorned with much curious embroidery and a fanciful tassel,—the
work of certain female devotees who were dying with admiration of their
favorite preacher. In short, he had a very youthful, gallant look;
and, adding to this a clear, rich voice, a slight fashionable lisp, a
peculiar grace in telling a story, a talent at mimicry, an easy action,
a taking manner, a high-sounding style, and<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_262">[p. 262]</span> not a little effrontery,—never
forgetting to sprinkle jests, proverbs, and homely phrases along his
discourses with a most agreeable aptness,—he won golden opinions in
his public discourses, and carried every thing before him in the
drawing-rooms he frequented.”<a id="FNanchor_327" href="#Footnote_327"
class="fnanchor">[327]</a></p>

<p>The style of eloquence of this vulgar ecclesiastical fop, a specimen
of which follows, is no less faithfully and characteristically
given; and was taken, as Father Isla intimates was his custom, from
a discourse that had really been preached.<a id="FNanchor_328"
href="#Footnote_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a></p>

<p>“It was well known, that he always began his sermons with some
proverb, some jest, some pot-house witticism, or some strange fragment,
which, taken from its proper connections and relations, would seem,
at first blush, to be an inconsequence, a blasphemy, or an impiety;
until, at last, having kept his audience waiting a moment in wonder,
he finished the clause, or came out with an explanation which reduced
the whole to a sort of miserable trifling. Thus, preaching one day on
the mystery of the Trinity, he began his sermon by saying, ‘I deny
that God exists a Unity in essence and a Trinity in person,’ and then
stopped short for an instant. The hearers, of course, looked round
on one another, scandalized, or, at least, wondering what would be
the end of this heretical blasphemy. At length, when the preacher
thought he had fairly caught them, he went on,—‘Thus says the Ebionite,
the Marcionite, the Arian, the Manichean, the Socinian; but I prove
it against them all from the Scriptures, the Councils, and the
Fathers.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[p. 263]</span>“In another
sermon, which was on the Incarnation, he began by crying out, ‘Your
health, cavaliers!’ and, as the audience burst into a broad laugh
at the free manner in which he had said it, he went on:—‘This is no
joking matter, however; for it was for your health and for mine, and
for that of all men, that Christ descended from heaven and became
incarnate in the Virgin Mary. It is an article of faith, and I prove it
thus: “Propter nos, homines, et nostram <i>salutem</i> descendit de cœlo et
incarnatus est,”’—whereat they all remained in delighted astonishment,
and such a murmur of applause ran round the church, that it wanted
little of breaking out into open acclamation.”<a id="FNanchor_329"
href="#Footnote_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a></p>

<p>The first volume of the “Friar Gerund” was printed in 1758, without
the knowledge of the author, and in twenty-four hours eight hundred
copies of it were sold.<a id="FNanchor_330" href="#Footnote_330"
class="fnanchor">[330]</a> Such an extraordinary popularity, however,
proved any thing but a benefit. The priests, and especially the
preaching friars, assailed it from all quarters, as the most formidable
attack yet made in Spain on their peculiar craft. The consequence was,
that, though the king and the court expressed their delight in its
satire, the license to publish it further was withdrawn, its author
was summoned before the Inquisition, and his book was condemned in
1760. But Isla was too strong in public favor and in the respect of
the Jesuits to be personally punished, and the Friar Gerund was too
true and too widely scattered to be more than nominally suppressed.<a
id="FNanchor_331" href="#Footnote_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[p. 264]</span>The second
volume did not fare so well. After the censure passed on the first,
it could not, of course, be licensed, and so remained for a long
time in manuscript, a forbidden book. In fact, it first appeared in
England, and in the English language, in 1772, through the agency of
Baretti, to whom the original had been sent after its author had gone
to Italy. But an edition of the whole work in Spanish soon appeared at
Bayonne, followed by other editions in other places; and, though it
was never licensed at home till 1813,—and then only to be forbidden
anew the next year, on the return of Ferdinand the Seventh,—still few
books have been better known, all over Spain, to the more intelligent
classes of the Spanish people, than Friar Gerund, from the day of its
first publication to the present time. What is of more consequence, it
was, from the first, successful in its main purpose. The <i>sobriquet</i>
of Friar Gerund was given at once to those who indulged in the
vulgar style of preaching it was intended to discountenance, and
any one who was admitted to deserve the appellation could no longer
collect an audience, except such as was gathered from the populace
of the public squares.<a id="FNanchor_332" href="#Footnote_332"
class="fnanchor">[332]</a></p>

<p>In consequence of the alarm and anxieties that accompanied his
sudden and violent expulsion from Spain, in 1767, Father Isla suffered
on the road an attack of paralysis, which made his health uncertain
for the remaining fourteen years of his life. Still, after his death,
it was found that in these sad years he had not been idle. Among his
papers was a poem in sixteen cantos, containing above twelve thousand
lines in octave stanzas. It is called “Cicero,” and claims to be a
life of the great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[p. 265]</span>
Roman orator. But it is no such thing. It is a satire on the vices and
follies of the author’s own time, begun in Spain, but chiefly written
during his exile in Italy; and, though it contains occasional sketches
of an imaginary life of Cicero’s mother, they are very inconsiderable,
and, as for Cicero himself, the poem leaves him in his cradle, only
eighteen months old.</p>

<p>One of the subjects of its satire is the whole class of Spanish
narrative poems, of which, and especially of those devoted to the lives
of the saints, it may be regarded as a sort of parody; but its main
purpose is to ridicule the lives of modern fine ladies, and the modes
of early education then prevalent. The whole, however, is mingled with
inappropriate discussions about Italy, poetry, and a country life, and
hardly less inappropriate satire of professed musicians, theatres,
and poets who praise one another; in short, with whatever occurred to
Father Isla’s wayward humor as he was writing. From internal evidence,
it seems to have been read, from time to time as it was written, to
a society of friends,—probably some of the numerous exiles who, like
himself, had resorted to Bologna, and subsisted there on the miserable
pittance the Spanish government promised them, but often failed to pay.
For such a purpose it was not ill adapted by its clear, flowing style,
and occasionally by its pungent satire; but its cumbrous length and
endless digressions, often trifling both in matter and manner, render
it quite unfit for publication. It was, however, offered to the public
censor, and permission to print it was refused, though for reasons so
frivolous, that it seems certain the real objection was not to the
poem, but to the author.<a id="FNanchor_333" href="#Footnote_333"
class="fnanchor">[333]</a></p> <p><span class="pagenum"
id="Page_266">[p. 266]</span></p> <p>Others of Father Isla’s works
were more fortunate. Six volumes of his sermons were collected and
published, and six volumes of his letters, chiefly addressed to
his sister and her husband, and written in a very affectionate and
gay spirit. To these, at different times, were added a few minor
works of a trifling character, and one or two that are religious.<a
id="FNanchor_334" href="#Footnote_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a></p>

<p>But what most surprised the world was his translation of “Gil
Blas,” printed in 1787, claiming the work, on which the fame of Le
Sage must always principally rest, as “stolen from the Spanish, and
now,” in the words of Father Isla’s title-page, “restored to its
country and native language by a Spaniard, who does not choose to have
his nation trifled with.”<a id="FNanchor_335" href="#Footnote_335"
class="fnanchor">[335]</a> The external grounds for this extraordinary
charge are slight. The first suggestion occurs in 1752, and is made by
Voltaire, who, in his “Age of Louis the Fourteenth,” declares<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[p. 267]</span> the Gil Blas “to be
entirely taken from Espinel’s ‘Marcos de Obregon.’” This charge, as we
have seen, is not true, and we have reason to believe that it was the
result of personal ill-will on the part of Voltaire, who had himself
been attacked in the Gil Blas, and who had, in some way or other, heard
that Le Sage was indebted to Espinel. Afterwards, similar declarations
are made in two or three books of no authority, and especially in a
Biographical Dictionary printed at Amsterdam in 1771. But this is
all.</p>

<p>Roused by such suggestions, however, Father Isla amused himself
with making a translation of Gil Blas, adding to it a long and not
successful continuation,<a id="FNanchor_336" href="#Footnote_336"
class="fnanchor">[336]</a> and declaring, without ceremony or proof,
that it was the work of an Andalusian advocate, who gave his manuscript
to Le Sage, when Le Sage was in Spain, either as a secretary of the
French embassy, or as a friend of the French ambassador. But all this
seems to be without any foundation, for the manuscript has never
been produced; the advocate has never been named; and Le Sage was
never in Spain. Still, the Spanish claim has not been abandoned. On
the contrary, Llorente, in two ingenious and learned works on the
subject, one in French and the other in Spanish, but both printed
in 1822, reasserts it, with great earnestness, resting his proofs
on internal evidence, and insisting that Gil<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_268">[p. 268]</span> Blas is certainly of Spanish origin, and
that it is probably the work, not indeed of Father Isla’s Andalusian
advocate, but of Solís, the historian;—a suggestion, for which
Llorente produces no better reason, than that nobody else of the
period to which he assigns the Gil Blas was able, in his judgment,
to write such a romance.<a id="FNanchor_337" href="#Footnote_337"
class="fnanchor">[337]</a></p>

<p>But there is a ready answer to all such merely conjectural
criticism. Le Sage proceeded, as an author in romantic fiction, just
as he had done when he wrote for the public theatre; and the results
at which he arrived in both cases are remarkably similar. In the
drama, he began with translations and imitations from the Spanish,
such as his “Point of Honor,” which is taken from Roxas, and his “Don
Cesar Ursino,” which is from Calderon; but afterwards, when he better
understood his own talent and had acquired confidence from success,
he came out with his “Turcaret,” a wholly original comedy, which,
far surpassed all he had be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[p.
269]</span>fore attempted, and showed how much he had been wasting his
strength as an imitator. Just so he did in romance-writing. He began
with translating the “Don Quixote” of Avellaneda, and remodelling
and enlarging the “Diablo Cojuelo” of Guevara. But the “Gil Blas,”
the greatest of all his works of prose fiction, is the result of his
confirmed strength; and, in its characteristic merits, is as much his
own as the “Turcaret.”</p>

<p>On this point, the internal evidence is as decisive as the external.
The frequent errors of this remarkable romance in Spanish geography and
history show, that it could hardly have been the work of a Spaniard,
and certainly not of a Spaniard so well informed as Solís; its private
anecdotes of society in the time of Louis the Fourteenth and Louis
the Fifteenth prove it to have been almost necessarily written by a
Frenchman; while, at the same time, the freedom with which, as we go
on, we find that every thing Spanish is plundered,—now a tale taken
from “Marcos de Obregon,” now an intrigue or a story from a play of
Mendoza, of Roxas, or of Figueroa,—points directly to Le Sage’s old
habits, and to his practised skill in turning to account every thing
that he deemed fitted to his purpose. The result is, that he has,
by the force of his genius, produced a work of great brilliancy; in
which, from his entire familiarity with Spanish literature and his
unscrupulous use of it, he has preserved the national character with
such fidelity, that a Spaniard is almost always unwilling to believe
that the Gil Blas, especially now that he has it in the excellent
version of Father Isla, could have been written by any body but one
of his own countrymen.<a id="FNanchor_338" href="#Footnote_338"
class="fnanchor">[338]</a></p> <p><span class="pagenum"
id="Page_270">[p. 270]</span></p> <p>The chief talent of Father Isla
was in satire, and the great service he performed for his country was
that of driving from its respectable churches the low and vulgar style
of preaching with which they had long been infested;—a work which the
“Friar Gerund” achieved almost as completely as the “Don Quixote” did
that of destroying the insane passion for books of chivalry which
prevailed in the seventeenth century.</p>

<p>But, meanwhile, other attempts were making in other directions to
revive the literature of the country; some by restoring a taste for the
old national poetry, some by attempting to accommodate every thing to
the French doctrines of the age of Louis the Fourteenth, and some by an
ill-defined and often, perhaps, unconscious struggle to unite the two
opinions, and to form a school whose character should be unlike that of
either and yet in advance of both.</p>

<p>In the direction of the earlier national poetry little was done
by original efforts, but something was attempted in other ways.
Huerta, a fierce, but inconsis<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[p.
271]</span>tent, adversary of the French innovations, printed, in
1778, a volume of poems almost entirely in the old manner; but it
was too much marked with the bad taste of the preceding century to
enjoy even a temporary success, and its author, therefore, could
boast of no follower of any note in a path which was constantly
less and less trodden.<a id="FNanchor_339" href="#Footnote_339"
class="fnanchor">[339]</a></p>

<p>On the other hand, more was done with effect to recall the memory
of the old masters themselves. Lopez de Sedano, between 1768 and 1778,
published his “Spanish Parnassus,” in nine volumes; a work which,
though ill digested and not always showing good taste in its selections
and criticisms, is still a rich mine of the poetry of the country
in its best days, and contains important materials for the history
of Spanish literature from the period of Boscan and Garcilasso.<a
id="FNanchor_340" href="#Footnote_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a>
Sanchez went further back, and in 1779 offered, to his countrymen, for
the first time, the greater legendary treasures of their heroic ages,
beginning with the noble old poem of the Cid, but unhappily leaving
incomplete a task for which he had proved himself so well fitted by
his learning and zeal, if not by his acuteness.<a id="FNanchor_341"
href="#Footnote_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a> And finally, Sarmiento,
a friend of Feyjoó, and one of his ablest public defenders, undertook
an elaborate history of Spanish<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[p.
272]</span> poetry, which contains important discussions relating
to the period embraced by the inquiries of Sanchez, but which
was broken off by the death of its venerable author in 1770, and
remained unpublished till five years later.<a id="FNanchor_342"
href="#Footnote_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a> These three works,
though they excited too little attention at first, were still works of
importance, and have served as the foundation for a better state of
things since.</p>

<p>The doctrines of the French school, somewhat modified, perhaps,
by the reproduction of the elder Spanish literature, but still
substantially unchanged, found followers more numerous and active.
During the reign of Charles the Third, Moratin the elder, a gentleman
of an old Biscayan family, who was born in 1737, and died in 1780,
succeeded, in a great degree, to the inheritance of Luzan’s opinions,
and devoted himself to the reform of the taste of his countrymen. He
was the friend of Montiano, who had himself endeavoured to introduce
classical tragedy upon the Spanish stage, and who had, probably,
some share in forming the literary character of the young poet. But
the court, as usual, was an element in the movement. Moratin was
received with flattering regard by the Duke of Medina-Sidonia, the
head of the great house of the Guzmans; by the Duke of Ossuna, long
ambassador in France; by Aranda, the wise minister of state, who rarely
forgot the cause of intellectual culture; and by the Infante Don
Gabriel de Bourbon, the accomplished translator of Sallust; and<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[p. 273]</span> each of these persons was
thus able, through Moratin, to exercise an influence on the state of
letters in Spain.</p>

<p>His first public effort of any consequence, except a drama that
will be noticed hereafter, was his “Poeta,” which appeared in 1764.
It consists entirely of his own shorter poems, and is among the many
proofs how small was the interest then felt in literature, since,
though the whole collection fills only a hundred and sixty pages, it
was found expedient to publish it in ten successive numbers, in order
to give it a fair opportunity to be circulated and read. This was
followed, the next year, by the “Diana,” a short didactic poem, in six
books, on the Chase, and in 1765 by a narrative poem on the Destruction
of his Ships by Cortés, to which if we add a volume published by the
piety of his son in 1821, and containing, with a modest and beautiful
life of their author, a collection of poems, most of which had not
before been published, we shall have all of the elder Moratin that can
now interest us.</p>

<p>Its value is not great; and yet portions of it are not likely to
be soon forgotten. The “Epic Canto,” as he calls it, on the bold
adventure of Cortés in burning his ships, is the noblest poem of its
class produced in Spain during the eighteenth century, and gives more
pleasure than almost any of the historical epics that preceded it in
such large numbers. Some of his shorter pieces, like his ballads on
Moorish subjects, and an ode to a champion in the bull-fights,—which
Moratin constantly frequented, and of which he printed a pleasant
historical sketch,—are full of spirit. All he wrote, indeed, is marked
by purity and exactness of language and harmony of versification;
showing that, though he possessed to an extraordinary degree the power
of an improvisator, he composed carefully and finished with<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[p. 274]</span> patience. But his
chief success was as a public teacher; laboring faithfully in the
chair of the Imperial College, where he took the place of his friend
Ayala, and rebuking the bad taste of his times by the strength of
his own modest example.<a id="FNanchor_343" href="#Footnote_343"
class="fnanchor">[343]</a></p>

<p>Moratin was an amiable man, and gathered the men of letters of
the Spanish capital in a friendly circle about him. They met in one
of the better class of taverns,—the Fonda de San Sebastian,—where
they maintained a club-room that was always open and ready to receive
them. Ayala, the tragic writer; Cerdá, the literary antiquarian; Rios,
who wrote the analysis of “Don Quixote” prefixed to the magnificent
edition of the Academy; Ortega, the botanist and scholar; Pizzi, the
Professor of Arabic Literature; Cadahalso, the poet and essayist;
Muñoz, the historian of the New World; Yriarte, the fabulist; Conti,
the Italian translator of a collection of Spanish poetry; Signorelli,
the author of the general history of theatres; and others,—were members
of this pleasant association, and resorted continually to its cheerful
saloon.</p>

<p>How truly Spanish was the tone of their intercourse may be
gathered from the fact, that they had but one law to govern all their
proceedings, and that was, never to speak on any subject except the
Theatre, Bull-fights, Love, and Poetry. But in every thing they
undertook<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[p. 275]</span> they
were much in earnest. They read their works to each other for mutual,
friendly criticism, and discussed freely whatever was written at the
time, and whatever they thought would tend to revive the decayed
spirit of their country. They read, too, and examined the literature
of other nations; and, if their tendencies were more towards the
school of Boileau and the great masters of Italy, than might have
been anticipated from the spirit of their association, it should be
borne in mind, that two of their most active members were Italian
men of letters, that the court had recently come from Naples, and
that the spirit of the times much favored all that was French, and
especially the French theatre.<a id="FNanchor_344" href="#Footnote_344"
class="fnanchor">[344]</a></p>

<p>Among the most interesting members of this agreeable society was
José de Cadahalso, a gentleman descended from one of the old mountain
families of the North of Spain, but born at Cadiz in 1741. His
education was conducted from early youth in Paris, but before he was
twenty years old he had visited Italy, Germany, England, and Portugal,
and obtained a knowledge of the language and literature of each, and
especially of England, sufficient to emancipate him from many national
prejudices, and make him more useful to the cause of letters at home
than he would otherwise have been.</p>

<p>On his return to Spain he took the military dress of Santiago, and
entered the army. There he rose rapidly, till he reached the rank of
colonel; but, in all the different places to which his own choice or
the service of his regiment carried him,—Saragossa, Madrid, Alcalá de
Henares, and Salamanca,—he sought occasion to<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_276">[p. 276]</span> continue his earlier pursuits, and
succeeded in connecting himself with the leading spirits of the time,
such as Moratin, Iglesias, Yriarte, the wise Jovellanos, and the young
and promising Melendez Valdes. But his career, though successful,
was short. He perished at the siege of Gibraltar, struck by a bomb,
on the 27th of February, 1782, and the governor of the besieged
fortress joined in the general sorrow over the grave of an honorable
enemy who had been distinguished alike in letters and in arms.<a
id="FNanchor_345" href="#Footnote_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a></p>

<p>In 1772 Cadahalso published his “Eruditos á la Violeta,” or
Fashionable Learning, to which, from its considerable success, he added
a supplement the same year. The original work is a pleasant satire on
the superficial scholarship of his times, and is thrown into the form
of directions how to teach the whole circle of human knowledge in a
course of lectures, that shall just fill the seven days of the week;
the supplement giving a few further illustrations of the same subject,
and some of the results of such teachings on the unhappy scholars who
had been its victims. This, with a volume of poems printed the next
year, and containing several careful translations from the ancients,
a few satirical trifles after the manner of Quevedo, and a good many
Anacreontic songs and tales in the manner of Villegas, are all of his
works that were published during his lifetime.</p>

<p>But after his death there was found among his papers a collection of
letters, supposed to have been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[p.
277]</span> written by a person connected with an embassy to Spain
from Morocco, and addressed to his friends at home. They belong to the
large family of works of fiction, begun by Marana’s “Turkish Spy,”
and are commonly set down as imitations of Montesquieu’s “Persian
Letters,” but, in fact, show a nearer relationship with Goldsmith’s
“Citizen of the World.” The whole work, however, is more occupied
with literary discussions and temporary satire, than either of those
just referred to; and therefore, though it is written in a pure and
pleasant style, with wit and good sense, it has been far from obtaining
a place, like theirs, in the general regard of the world. Still,
like the rest of his posthumous works, which comprise a few more
compositions in prose satire and a few more poems, the best of which
are in the old short verses always so popular in Spain, “The Moorish
Letters” of Cadahalso have been often reprinted, and probably are not
destined to be forgotten.<a id="FNanchor_346" href="#Footnote_346"
class="fnanchor">[346]</a></p>

<p>Another member of the society founded by Moratin, and one of the
most prominent of them, was Thomas de Yriarte, a gentleman who was
born on the island of Teneriffe in 1750, but received that part of
his education which decided the course of his life at Madrid, under
the auspices of his uncle, Don Juan de Yriarte, the learned head of
the King’s Library. The young man was known as a dramatic writer,
and as a translator of French plays for the royal theatres, from the
age of eighteen; and from the age of twenty-one, when he printed
some good Latin verses on the birth of the<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_278">[p. 278]</span> Infante, afterwards Charles the Fourth,
he was distinguished at court for his accomplishments both in ancient
and modern literature. Soon after this period he received a place
under the government; and, though his employments, both in the Office
of Foreign Affairs and in that of the Department of War, were of an
intellectual nature, still his time was much occupied by them, and
his opportunities for the indulgence of a poetical taste were much
diminished. Besides this, he had rivalries and troubles with Sedano,
Melendez, Forner, and some others of his contemporaries, and was
summoned before the Inquisition in 1786, as one tainted with the new
French philosophy. The result of all these trials and interruptions
was, that when, after his death, which occurred in 1791, his works were
collected and published, more than half of the eight small volumes
through which they were spread was found to consist of translations
and personal controversies; the translations made with skill, and the
quarrels managed with spirit and wit, but neither of them important
enough to be now remembered.</p>

<p>His original poetry is better. It is marked by purity of style,
regularity, and elegance, but not by power or elevation. The best of
what is merely miscellaneous is to be found in eleven Epistles, with
one of which, addressed to his friend Cadahalso, he dedicates to him
a translation of Horace’s “Art of Poetry.” But in two departments,
where his natural taste led him to labor with a decided preference,
he apparently made more effort than in any other, and had greater
success.</p>

<p>The first of these was didactic poetry. His poem “On Music,”—a
subject which he chose from his considerable proficiency in that
art,—appeared in 1780, and was soon favorably known, not only at home,
but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[p. 279]</span> in Italy
and France. It consists of five books, in which he discusses with
philosophical precision the elements of music; musical expression
of different kinds, but especially martial and sacred; the music of
the theatre; that of society; and that of man in solitude. The poem
is written in the free, national <i>silva</i>, irregular, but flowing,
and no want of skill is shown in its management. But, as a whole,
it has too little richness and vigor to give life to the cold
forms of instruction, in which it is throughout rigorously cast.<a
id="FNanchor_347" href="#Footnote_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a></p>

<p>The other department, in which Yriarte was more successful, was
that of fables. Here he, in some degree, struck out a new path; for he
not only invented all his fictions, which no other fabulist in modern
times had done, but restricted them all, in their moral purpose, to the
correction of the faults and follies of men of learning,—an application
which had not before been thought of. Their whole number, including
a few that are posthumous, is nearly eighty, above sixty of which
appeared in 1782. They are written with great care, in no less than
forty different measures, and show an extraordinary degree of ingenuity
in adapting the attributes and instincts of animals to the instruction,
not of mankind at large, as had always been done before, but to that of
a separate and small class, between whom and the inferior creation the
resemblance is rarely obvious. The task was certainly a difficult one.
Perhaps, on this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[p. 280]</span>
account, they are too narrative in their structure, and fail somewhat
in the genial spirit which distinguishes Æsop and La Fontaine, the
greatest masters of Apologue and Fable. But their influence was so
much needed in the age of bad writing when they appeared, and they are
besides so graceful in their versification, that they were not only
received with great favor at first, but have never lost it since. Their
author’s reputation, in fact, now rests on them almost exclusively.<a
id="FNanchor_348" href="#Footnote_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a></p>

<p>Yriarte, however, had a rival, who shared these honors with him,
and in some respects obtained them even earlier. This was Samaniego, a
Biscayan gentleman of rank and fortune, who was born in 1745, and died
in 1801; having devoted his life, in the most disinterested manner,
to the welfare of his native province. He was one of the earliest
and most active members of the first of those societies sometimes
called “Friends of the Country,” and sometimes “Societies for Public
Improvement,” which began in the reign of Charles the Third, and
soon spread through Spain, exercising an important influence on the
education and public economy of the kingdom, and laboring to raise the
arts of life from the degraded condition into which they had fallen
during the latter period of the dominion of the House of Austria.</p>

<p>The Biscayan Society, founded in 1765, devoted itself much to the
education of the people; and, to favor this great cause, Samaniego
undertook to write fables suited to the capacity of the children
taught in the Society’s seminary. How early he began to prepare them
is not known; but in the first portion, published in 1781, and<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[p. 281]</span> therefore one year
before those of Yriarte appeared, he speaks of Yriarte as his model,
and leaves no doubt that the fables of that poet had been seen by him.
The second part of Samaniego’s collection was published in 1784, when
that of his rival had been admired by the public long enough to change
the relations of the two authors, and bring up a quarrel of pamphlets
between them, little creditable to either. Both parts, taken together,
contain a hundred and fifty-seven fables, the last nineteen of which
and a few others are original, while the rest are taken, partly from
Æsop, Phædrus, and the Oriental fabulists, but chiefly from La Fontaine
and Gay. They succeeded at once. The children learned them by heart,
and the teachers of the children found in them subjects for pleasant
reading and reflection. They were, no doubt, less carefully written
than the fables of Yriarte, less original and less exactly adapted
to their purpose; but they were more free-hearted, more natural, and
adapted to a larger class of readers; in short, there is a more easy
poetical genius about them, and therefore, even if they cannot claim
a higher merit than those of Yriarte, they have taken a stronger hold
on the national regard.<a id="FNanchor_349" href="#Footnote_349"
class="fnanchor">[349]</a></p>

<p>The best of them are the shortest and simplest, like the following,
entitled “The Scrupulous Cats,” which was well suited to the time when
it appeared, and can hardly be amiss at any other.</p>

<div class="poem mt1"><div class="stanza">

<p class="i0">“And <i>did</i> they eat it?” “Sir, I trow,</p>

<p class="i0">Who had a conscience, and knew how it stings.”<a id="FNanchor_350" href="#Footnote_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a></p>
</div></div>

<p class="mt1">Samaniego was not the only person who, without
belonging to the society of Moratin and his friends, coöperated with
them in their efforts to encourage a better tone in the literature
of their country. Among those who, from a similar impulse, but with
less success, took the same direction, were Arroyal, who, in 1784,
published a collection of poems, which he calls Odes, but which are
oftener epigrams; and Montengon, a Jesuit, who, after the expulsion
of his Order from Spain, began, in 1786, with his “Eusebio,” a work
on education, partly in imitation of the “Télémaque,” and then went
on rapidly with a prose epic called “Rodrigo,” a volume of Odes, and
several other works, written with little talent, and showing by their
inaccuracies of style that their author had been an exile in Italy
till his mother tongue had become strange to him. To these should be
added Gregorio de Salas, a quiet ecclesiastic, who wrote odes, fables,
and other trifles, that were several times printed after 1790; Ignacio
de Meras, a courtier of the worst days of Charles the Fourth, whose
worthless dramas and miscellaneous poetry appeared in 1792; and the
Count de Noroña, a soldier and diplomatist, who, besides a dull epic
on the separation of the Arabian empire in Spain from that of the
East, printed, in 1799-1800,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[p.
283]</span> two volumes of verse so light, that they procured for him
sometimes the title of the Spanish Dorat. But all these writers only
showed a constantly increasing disposition to fall more and more into
the feebler French school of the eighteenth century; and while none
of them had the talent of the few active spirits collected at the
Fonda de San Sebastian in Madrid, none certainly exercised the sort of
influence they did on the poetry of their time.<a id="FNanchor_351"

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Both</span> the parties, into which Spanish
literature was divided about the middle of the eighteenth century,
erred by running into those extremes of opinion which are rarely
right in any thing and never in matters of taste. Moratin was wrong
in speaking with contempt of such poetry as the fine old ballad of
“Calaynos,” and Huerta was equally wrong when he said, that the
“Athalie” of Racine might be fit to be represented by boarding-school
misses, but was fit for nothing else. It was natural, therefore, that
another party, or school, should be formed, which should endeavour to
avoid the excesses of both its predecessors, and unite their merits;
one that should not be insensible to the power and richness of the
old writers of the time of the Philips, and yet, escaping from their
extravagances and bad taste, should mould itself in some degree
according to the severe state of literary opinion then prevailing on
the Continent. Such a school in fact appeared at Salamanca in the
latter part of the reign of Charles the Third and the beginning of that
of Charles the Fourth.</p>

<p>Its proper founder was Melendez Valdes, who was born in
Estremadura, in 1754, and at the age of eighteen<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_286">[p. 286]</span> was sent to study at Salamanca, where,
if he did not pass the larger remaining portion of his life, he
passed at least its happiest and best years.<a id="FNanchor_352"
href="#Footnote_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a> As a versifier, he
began early, and in a bad school; writing at first in the manner of
Lobo, who was still read and admired. But he soon fell indirectly under
the influence of Moratin and his friends at Madrid, who were in every
way opposed to the bad taste of their time. By a fortunate accident
Cadahalso was carried fresh from the meetings of the club of the Fonda
de San Sebastian to Salamanca. His discerning kindness detected at
once the talent its possessor had not yet discovered. He took Melendez
into his house; showed him the merit of the elder literature of his
country, as well as that of the other cultivated nations of Europe; and
devoted himself so earnestly and so affectionately to the development
of his young friend’s genius, that it was afterwards said, with some
truth, that, among all the works of Cadahalso, the best was Melendez.
At the same period, too, Melendez became acquainted with Iglesias and
Gonzalez; and through the latter was placed in relations of friendship
with the commanding mind of Jovellanos, who exercised from the first
moment of their intercourse an obvious and salutary influence over
him.</p>

<p>His earliest public success was in 1780, when he obtained a prize
offered by the Spanish Academy for the best eclogue. Yriarte, who was
some years older, and had already become favorably known at court and
in the capital, was his most formidable rival. But the poem Yriarte
offered, which is on the pleasures of a country life, as set forth by
one disgusted with that of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[p.
287]</span> the city, is somewhat in the formal, declamatory style of
the less fortunate portions of the older Spanish pastorals; while that
of Melendez is fresh from the fields, and as one of the judges said, in
the discussion that followed its reading, seems absolutely to smell of
their wild flowers. It was, indeed, in sweetness and gentleness, if not
in originality and strength, such a return to the tones of Garcilasso,
as had not been heard in Spain for above a century. Yriarte received
the second honors of the contest, but was not satisfied with such a
decision, and made known his feelings by an ill-judged attack upon the
successful eclogue of his rival. The popular favor, however, fully
sustained the Academy, and its vote on that occasion has never been
reversed.</p>

<p>The next year Melendez came to Madrid. He was received with great
kindness by Jovellanos and his friends; and obtained new honors at
the Academy of San Fernando, by an ode “On the Glory of the Arts,”
which that Academy had been founded to foster. But his preference was
still for his old poetical haunts on the banks of the Tórmes, and,
having obtained the chair of Professor of the Humanities or Philology,
at Salamanca, he gladly returned thither, and devoted himself to its
unostentatious duties.</p>

<p>In 1784, at the suggestion of Jovellanos, he became a competitor for
the prize offered by the city of Madrid for a comedy, and wrote “The
Marriage of Camacho.” But his talent was not dramatic; and therefore,
though he obtained the votes of the judges, he did not, to the great
disappointment of his patron, obtain those of the public when his drama
was brought to the test of a free representation.</p>

<p>This failure, however, he retrieved a year afterwards, by publishing
a small volume of poetry, chiefly lyric<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_288">[p. 288]</span> and pastoral. Most of it is in the short,
national verse, and nearly all is marked with a great gentleness of
spirit and a truly poetical sensibility. The Anacreontics which it
contains remind us of Villegas, but have more philosophy and more
tenderness than his. The ballads, for which his talent was no less
happily fitted, if they lack the abrupt vigor of the elder times, have
a grace, a lightness, and a finish which belong to that more advanced
period of a nation’s poetry, when the popular lyre has ceased to give
forth new and original tones. But everywhere this little volume shows
traces of an active fancy and powers of nice observation, which break
forth in rich and faithful descriptions of natural scenery, and in
glimpses of what is tenderest and truest in the human heart. It was,
in fact, a volume of poetry more worthy of the country than any that
had been produced in Spain since the disappearance of the great lights
of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries; and it was received, in
consequence, with general enthusiasm, not only for its own sake, but as
the long-looked-for dawn of a brighter day.</p>

<p>But his success was not altogether wisely used by Melendez. He had
been in the habit for some years of spending his vacations at court,
where he was a favorite with many persons of distinction; and, now
that he had risen so much in general consideration, he employed his
influence in soliciting for himself a place under the government,—an
old weakness in the Castilian character, which, however it might
be disguised by the loyalty of public service, has broken down the
independence and happiness of multitudes of high-minded men who have
yielded to it. Melendez, unfortunately, succeeded in his aspirations.
In 1789 he was made a judge in one of the courts of Saragossa, and in
1791 was raised to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[p. 289]</span>
a dignified position in the Chancery of Valladolid; thus involving
himself more or less with the political government of the country, to
which, during the administration of the Prince of the Peace, every
officer it employed was in some way made subservient.</p>

<p>He did not, however, neglect his favorite pursuits. He fulfilled
with faithfulness and ability the duties of his place; but poetry
was still his first love, for whose service he rescued many hours of
secret and fond devotion. In 1797, he published a new edition of his
works, more than doubling their original amount, and dedicating them
to the reigning favorite,—the master of all fortunes in the country he
governed so ill. It was successful. The new portions wore a somewhat
graver and more philosophical air than his earliest lyrics and
pastorals had done, and showed more the influence of studies in English
and German literature. But this was not, on the whole, an improvement.
He felt, undoubtedly, that the tremendous revolutions he witnessed on
all sides, in the fall of kingdoms and the convulsions of society,
prescribed to poetry subjects more lofty and solemn than he had been
wont to seek; and he made an effort to rise to a requisition so severe.
Once or twice he intimates a consciousness that he was not equal to the
undertaking; and yet his “Ode to Winter,” as a season for reflection,
which shows how much he had read Thomson, his “Ode to Truth,” and
his “Ode on the Presence of God in his Works,” are not unworthy of
their lofty subjects. Several of his philosophical epistles, too,
are good; especially those to Jovellanos and the Prince of the
Peace. But, in his longer <i>canzones</i>, where he sometimes imitates
Petrarch, and in his epic canto on “The Fall of Lucifer,” which<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[p. 290]</span> was evidently suggested
by Milton, he failed.<a id="FNanchor_353" href="#Footnote_353"
class="fnanchor">[353]</a> On the whole, therefore, the attempt to
introduce a new tone into Spanish poetry,—a tone of moral and, in
some degree, of metaphysical discussion, to which he was urged by
Jovellanos,—if it did not diminish the permanent fame of Melendez, did
not add to it. The concise energy and philosophical precision such a
tone requires are, in fact, foreign from the fervent genius of the old
Castilian verse, and hardly consistent with that submissive religious
faith which is one of the most important elements of the national
character. In this direction, therefore, Melendez has been little
followed.</p>

<p>As, however, we have intimated, this new publication of his works
was successful. The Prince of the Peace was flattered by his share in
it; and Melendez received, in consequence, an important employment
about the court, which brought him to Madrid, where, his friend
Jovellanos having been made a minister of state, his position became,
for a moment, most agreeable and happy; while, for the future, a long
vista of preferment and fame seemed opening before him. But the very
next year, the virtuous and wise man on whom rested so many hopes,
besides those of Melendez, fell from power; and, according to the old
custom of the Spanish monarchy, his political friends were involved
in his ruin. At first, Melendez was exiled to Medina del Campo, and
afterwards to Zamora; but in 1802 the rigor of his persecution was
mitigated, and he was permitted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[p.
291]</span> to return to Salamanca, the scene of his earliest and
happiest fame.</p>

<p>But he returned there a saddened and disappointed man; little
inclined to poetical studies, and with little of the tranquillity of
spirit necessary to pursue them successfully. At the end of six weary
years came the revolution of Aranjuez, and he was again free. He
hastened at once to Madrid. But he was too late. The king was already
at Bayonne, and the French power was in the ascendant in the capital.
Unfortunately, he attached himself to the new government of Joseph, and
shared first its disasters and then its fate. Once he was absolutely
led out to be shot by the excited population of Oviedo, where he
had been sent as a commissioner. On another occasion, his house at
Salamanca was sacked, and his precious library destroyed, by the very
French party whose interests he served. At last, when all was lost, he
fled. But, before he crossed the frontier, he knelt down and kissed the
last spot of earth that he could call Spain; and then, as the Bidassoa
received his tears, cried out in anguish that “he should never again
tread the soil of his country.” His prophecy was fulfilled as sadly as
it was made. Four miserable years he lived as an exile in the South
of France, and then died at Montpellier, on the 24th of May, 1817,
in poverty and suffering.<a id="FNanchor_354" href="#Footnote_354"
class="fnanchor">[354]</a></p>

<p>To solace the heavy hours of his exile, he occupied himself
with preparing the materials for a final publication of all he had
written, embracing many new po<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[p.
292]</span>ems and many changes in those already published;—all which
appeared in 1820, and have constituted the basis of the different
editions of his works that have been given to the world since. Like
the previous collections, it shows, not, indeed, a poetical genius
of the first order, nor one with very flexible or very various
attributes, but certainly a genius of great sweetness; always winning
and graceful whenever the subject implies tenderness, and sometimes
vigorous and imposing when it demands power. What Melendez wrote with
success was a great advance upon the poetry of Montiano, and even
upon that of the elder Moratin. It was more Castilian, and more full
of feeling, than theirs. In style, too, it was more free, and it has
done much to settle the poetical manner that has since prevailed.
Gallicisms occasionally occur that might have been avoided, though
many of them have now become a part of the recognized resources of
Spanish poetry; but more often Melendez has revived old and neglected
words and phrases, which have thus been restored to their place in
the language, and have increased its wealth. As a general remark,
his verse is not only flowing, but well suited to his subjects; and
whether we consider what he has done himself, or what influence he has
exercised over others,—especially when we read the little volume he
published in the freshness of his youth, while he was still unknown
at court and still careless of the convulsions that were at last to
overwhelm him,—there can be no doubt that he was better fitted to
form a new school and give a guiding impulse to the national poetry
than any writer that had appeared in Spain for above a century.<a
id="FNanchor_355" href="#Footnote_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[p. 293]</span></p> <p>Older
than Melendez, but somewhat influenced by him and by Cadahalso, who
had an effect on the taste of both, was the excellent Father Diego
Gonzalez, a modest Augustinian monk, a part of whose life was spent in
active religious duties at Salamanca, where he became intimate with
the poets of the new school; a part of it at Seville, where he was
the friend of Jovellanos; and a part of it at Madrid, where he died
in 1794, about sixty years old, sincerely lamented by some of the
noblest spirits of his time. As a poet, Gonzalez adhered more to the
old Castilian school than Melendez did. But his model was the best. He
imitated Luis de Leon; and did it with such happy success, that, in
some of his odes and in some of his versions of the Psalms, we might
almost think we were listening to the solemn tones of his great master.
His most popular poems, however, were light and gay; such as his verses
“To a Perfidious Bat,” which have been very often printed; his verses
“To a Lady who had burned her Finger”; and similar trifles, in which
he showed that all the secret idiomatic graces of the old Castilian
were at his command. A didactic poem on “The Four Ages of Man,” which
he began, and in the first book of which there is a fine dedication of
the whole to Jovellanos, was never finished. Indeed, his poetry, though
much known and circulated during his lifetime, was an object of little
interest or care to himself, and was collected<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_294">[p. 294]</span> with difficulty after his death, and
published by his faithful friend, Juan Fernandez.<a id="FNanchor_356"
href="#Footnote_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a></p>

<p>Other poets, among whom were Forner, Iglesias, and Cienfuegos,
were more under the influence of the Salamanca school than Gonzalez
was. Forner, like Melendez, was born in Estremadura, and the two
young friends were educated together at Salamanca. In his critical
opinions,—partly shown in a satire “On the Faults introduced into
Castilian Poetry,” which gained an academic prize in 1782, and partly
in his controversies with Huerta on the subject of the Spanish
theatre,—he inclines much to the stricter French school. But his
poetry is more free than such opinions would imply; and in his latter
years, when he lived as a magistrate at Seville, and studied Herrera,
Rioja, and the other old masters who were natives of its soil, he
attached himself yet more decidedly to the national manner, and
approached nearer to the serene severity of Gonzalez. Unhappily, his
life, besides being much crowded with business, was short. He died
in 1797, only forty-one years old; and, except his prose works, the
best of which is a well-written defence of the literary reputation of
his country against the injurious imputations of foreigners, he left
little to give the world proof of the merits he possessed, or the
influence he really exercised.<a id="FNanchor_357" href="#Footnote_357"
class="fnanchor">[357]</a></p>

<p>Iglesias, though his life was even shorter, was, in some
respects, more fortunate. He was born in Sala<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_295">[p. 295]</span>manca, and educated there under the most
favorable auspices. Offended at the low state of morals in his native
city, he indulged himself at first in the free forms of Castilian
satire;—ballads, apologues, epigrams, and especially the half-simple,
half-malicious <i>letrillas</i>, in which he was eminently successful. But,
when he became a parish priest, he thought such lightness unbecoming
the example he wished to set before his flock. He devoted himself,
therefore, to serious composition; wrote serious ballads, eclogues,
and <i>silvas</i> in the manner of Melendez; and published a didactic poem
on theology;—all a result of a most worthy purpose, and all written
in the pure style which is one of his prominent merits; but none of
it giving token of the instinctive promptings of his genius, and none
of it fitted to increase his final reputation. After his death, which
occurred in 1791, when he was thirty-eight years old, this became at
once apparent. His works were collected and published in two volumes;
the first being filled with the graver class of his poems, and the
second with the satirical. The decision of the public was instant. His
lighter poems were too free, but they were better imitations of Quevedo
than had yet been seen, and became favorites at once; the serious
poems were dull, and soon ceased to be read.<a id="FNanchor_358"
href="#Footnote_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a></p>

<p>Cienfuegos, who was ten years younger than Melendez, was more
strictly his follower than either of the two poets last mentioned.
But he had fallen on evil times, and his career, which promised to be
brilliant, was cut<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[p. 296]</span>
short by the troubles they brought upon him. In 1798 he published his
poetical works; the miscellaneous portion consisting of Anacreontics,
odes, ballads, epistles, and elegies, which, while they give proof of
much real talent and passion, show sometimes an excess of sentimental
feeling, and sometimes a desire to imitate the metaphysical and
philosophical manner supposed to be demanded by the spirit of the age.
Both were defects, to which he had been partly led by the example of
his friend and master, Melendez, at whose feet he long sat in the
cloisters of Salamanca; and both were affectations, from which a
character so manly and decided as that of Cienfuegos might in time have
emancipated itself.</p>

<p>But the favor with which this publication was received procured for
him the place of editor of the government gazette, at Madrid; and,
when the French occupied that capital, in 1808, he was found firm at
his post, determined to do his duty to his country. Murat, who had
the command of the invading forces, endeavoured, at first, to seduce
or drive him into submission, but, failing in this, condemned him
to death; a sentence which would infallibly have been carried into
execution,—since Cienfuegos refused to make the smallest concession to
the French authority,—if his friends had not interfered and procured
a commutation of it into transportation to France. The change,
however, was hardly a mercy. The sufferings of the journey, in which
he travelled as a prisoner; the grief he felt at leaving his friends
in hands which had hardly spared his own life; and the anticipation of
a long exile in the midst of his own and his country’s enemies, were
too much for his patriotic and generous spirit; and he died in July,
1809, at the age of forty-five, only a few days<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_297">[p. 297]</span> after he had reached the spot assigned
for his punishment.<a id="FNanchor_359" href="#Footnote_359"
class="fnanchor">[359]</a></p>

<p>One other person, already referred to with honor, must now be
particularly noticed, who, if his life belonged to the state, still
wrote poetry with success, and exercised over the school formed at
Salamanca an influence which belongs to the history of letters. This
person was Jovellanos, the wise magistrate and minister of Charles the
Fourth, and the victim of his master’s unworthy weakness and of the
still more unworthy vengeance of the reigning favorite. He was born in
Gijon, in Asturias, in 1744, and from his earliest youth seems to have
shown that love of intellectual cultivation, and that moral elevation
of character, which distinguished the whole of the more mature portions
of his life.</p>

<p>The position of his family was such, that all the means for a
careful education to be found in Spain were open to him; and, as he
was originally destined to the higher dignities of the Church, he was
sent to study philosophy and the canon and civil law at Oviedo, Avila,
Alcalá de Henares, and Madrid. But, just as he was about to take the
irrevocable step that would have bound him to an ecclesiastical life,
some of his friends, and especially the distinguished statesman, Juan
Arias de Saavedra, who was like a second father to him, interfered,
and changed his destination. The consequence of this intervention was,
that, in 1767, he was sent as a judicial magistrate to Seville, where,
by his humane spirit, and his disinterested and earnest devotion to
the duties of a difficult and disagreeable place, he made him<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[p. 298]</span>self generally loved and
respected; while, at the same time, by his study of political economy
and the foundations of all just legislation, he prepared the way for
his own future eminence in the affairs of his country.</p>

<p>But the spirit of Jovellanos was of kindred with whatever was noble
and elevated. At Seville, he early discovered the merit of Diego
Gonzalez, and through him was led into a correspondence with Melendez.
One result of this is still to be found in the poetical Epistle of
Jovellanos to his friends in Salamanca, exhorting them to rise to
the highest strains of poetry. Another was the establishment of a
connection between himself and Melendez, which, while it was important
to the young school at Salamanca, led Jovellanos to give more of his
leisure to the elegant literature he had always loved, but from which
the serious business of life had, for some time, much separated him.</p>

<p>In consequence of an accidental conversation, he wrote at Seville
his prose comedy of “The Honored Criminal,” which had a remarkable
success; and in 1769 he prepared a poetical tragedy on the subject of
Pelayo, which was not printed till several years afterward. Shorter
poetical compositions, sometimes grave and sometimes gay, served to
divert his mind in the intervals of severe labor; and when, after a
period of ten years, he left the brilliant capital of Andalusia, his
poetical Epistle to his friends there shows how deeply he felt that he
was leaving behind him the happiest period of his life.</p>

<p>This was in 1778, when he was called to Madrid, as one of the
principal magistrates of the capital and court; a place that brought
him again into the administration of criminal justice, from which,
during his stay at Seville, he had been relieved. His duties were
distaste<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[p. 299]</span>ful to
his nature, but he fulfilled them faithfully, and consoled himself
by intercourse with such men as Campomanes and Cabarrus, who devoted
themselves, as he did, to the great task of raising the condition of
their country. Of course, he had now little leisure for poetry. But,
being accidentally employed on affairs of consequence at the Paular
convent, he was so struck by the solemn scenery in which it stood, and
the tranquil lives of its recluse inhabitants, that his poetical spirit
broke out afresh in an address to Mariano Colon, one of the family of
the great discoverer of America, and afterwards its head;—a beautiful
epistle, full of the severe genius of the place that inspired it, and
of its author’s longing for a repose his spirit was so well fitted to
enjoy.</p>

<p>In 1780, he was raised to a place in the Council of Orders, where he
had more leisure, and was able to give his time to higher objects;—some
of the results of which are to be seen in his report to the government
on the military and religious Orders of Knighthood; in his system of
instruction for the Imperial College of Calatrava; in his Discourse
on the Study of History, as a necessary part of the wise study of
jurisprudence; and in other similar labors, which proved him to be
incontestably an excellent prose-writer, and the first philosophical
statesman in the kingdom.</p>

<p>At the same time, however, he amused himself with elegant
literature, and took great solace in collecting around him the poets
and men of letters whom he loved. In 1785, he wrote several burlesque
ballads on the quarrels of Huerta, Yriarte, and Forner about the
theatre; and the next year published two satires in blank verse and
in the style of Juvenal, rebuking the corrupted manners of his times.
All of them were received<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[p.
300]</span> with favor; and the ballads, though not printed till long
afterwards, were perhaps only the more effective because they were
circulated in manuscript, and so became matters of great interest.</p>

<p>Persons who held the tone implied in such a course of public labors
might be sustained at the court of Charles the Third, but were little
likely to enjoy regard at that of his son. In 1790, two years after
Charles the Fourth ascended the throne, Count Cabarrus not only fell
from power, but was thrown into prison; and Jovellanos, who did not
hesitate to defend him, was sent to Asturias in a sort of honorable
exile, that lasted eight years. But he served his fellow-men as gladly
in disgrace as he did in power. Hardly, therefore, had he reached his
native city, when he set about urging forward all public improvements
that he deemed useful; laboring in whatever related to the mines and
roads, and especially in whatever related to the general education
of the people, with the most disinterested zeal. During this period
of enforced retirement, he made many reports to the government on
different subjects connected with the general welfare, and wrote his
excellent tract “On Public Amusements,” afterwards published by the
Academy of History, and his elaborate treatise on Legislation in
Relation to Agriculture, which extended his reputation throughout
Europe, and has been the basis of all that has been wisely undertaken
in Spain on that difficult subject ever since.</p>

<p>In 1797, Count Cabarrus was restored to the favor of Godoy, Prince
of the Peace, and Jovellanos was recalled to court and made Minister
of Justice. But his season of favor was short. Godoy still hated
the elevated views of the man to whom he had reluctantly delegated
a small portion of his own power; and in<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_301">[p. 301]</span> 1798, under the pretext of devoting
him to his old employments, he was again exiled to the mountains of
Asturias, which, like so many other distinguished men that have sprung
from them, he loved with a fond prejudice that he did not care to
disguise.</p>

<p>This exile, however, did not satisfy the jealous favorite. In 1801,
partly through a movement of the Inquisition, and still more through a
political intrigue, Jovellanos was suddenly seized in his bed, and, in
violation both of law and decency, carried, like a common felon, across
the whole kingdom, and embarked at Barcelona for Majorca. There he was
confined, first in a convent and afterwards in a fortress, with such
rigor, that all communication with his friends and with the affairs of
the world was nearly cut off; and there he remained, for seven long
years, exposed to privations and trials that undermined his health and
broke down his constitution. At last came the abdication and fall of
his weak and ungrateful sovereign. “And then,” says Southey, in his
“History of the Peninsular War,” “next to the punishment of Godoy, what
all men most desired was the release of Jovellanos.” He was, therefore,
at once brought back, and everywhere welcomed with the affection and
respect, that he had earned by so many services and through such unjust
sufferings.</p>

<p>His infirmities, however, were very oppressive to him. He declined,
therefore, all public employments, even among his friends who adhered
to the cause of their country; he indignantly rejected the proposal of
the French invaders to become one of the principal ministers of state
in the new order of things they hoped to establish; and then slowly
and sadly retired, to seek among his native mountains the repose he
needed. But he was not permitted long to remain there. As soon<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[p. 302]</span> as the first central
Junta was organized at Seville, he was sent to it to represent his
native province, and stood forth in its councils the leading spirit
in the darkest and most disheartening moments of the great contest of
his country for existence. On the dissolution of that body,—which was
dissolved at his earnest desire,—he again returned home, broken down
with years, labors, and sufferings; trusting that he should now be
permitted to end his days in peace.</p>

<p>But no man with influence such as his could then have peace in
Spain. Like others, in those days of revolution, he was assailed by
the fierce spirit of faction, and in 1811 replied triumphantly to his
accusers in a defence of what may be considered his administration of
Spain in the two preceding years, written with the purity, elegance,
and gravity of manner which marked his best days, and with a moral
fervor even more eloquent than he had shown before. As he approaches
the conclusion of this personal vindication, admirable alike for its
modesty and its power, he says, with a sorrow he does not strive to
conceal:—</p>

<p>“And now that I am about to lay down my pen, I feel a secret
trouble at my heart, which will disturb the rest of my life. It has
been impossible for me to defend myself without offending others;
and I fear, that, for the first time, I shall begin to feel I have
enemies whom I have myself made such. But, wounded in that honor which
is my life, and asking in vain for an authority that would protect
and rescue me, I have been compelled to attempt my own defence by my
own pen; the only weapon left in my hands. To use it with absolute
moderation, when I was driven on by an anguish so sharp, was a hard
task. One more dexterous in such contests might, by the cunning of his
art, have oftener<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[p. 303]</span>
inflicted wounds, and received them more rarely; but, feeling myself to
be fiercely attacked, and coming to the contest unskilled and alone,
I threw my unprotected person into it, and, in order to free myself
from the more imminent danger before me, took no thought of any that
might follow. Indeed, such was the impulse by which I was driven on,
that I lost sight, at once, of considerations which, at another time,
might well have prevailed with me. Veneration for public authority,
respect for official station, the private affections of friendship
and personal attachment,—every thing within me yielded to the love of
justice, and to the earnest desire that truth and innocence should
triumph over calumny and falsehood. And can I, after this, be pardoned,
either by those who have assailed me, or by those who have refused me
their protection? Surely it matters little. The time has come in which
all disapprobation, except that of honorable men and the friends of
justice, must be indifferent to me. For now that I find myself fast
approaching the final limits of human life, now that I am alone and
in poverty, without a home or a shelter, what remains for me to ask,
beyond the glory and liberty of my country, but leave to die with the
good name I have labored to earn in its service?”</p>

<p>At the moment when this eloquent defence of himself was published,
the French, by a sudden incursion, took military possession of his
native city; and he hurried for safety on board a slight vessel,
hardly knowing whither his course should be directed. After suffering
severely from a storm of eight days’ continuance in the Bay of Biscay,
he disembarked to obtain relief at the obscure port of Vega. But his
strength was gone; and on the 27th of November, within forty-eight
hours from the time of his landing, he died. He was nearly sixty-eight
years old.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[p. 304]</span>Jovellanos left
behind him few men, in any country, of a greater elevation of mind,
and fewer still of a purer or more irreproachable character. Whatever
he did was for Spain and his fellow-men, to whose service he devoted
himself alike in the days of his happiness and of his suffering;—in
his influence over the school of Salamanca, when he exhorted them
to raise the tone of their poetry, no less than in the war-cry of
his odes to cheer on his countrymen in their conflict for national
independence;—in his patient counsels for the cause of education, when
he was an exile in Asturias or a prisoner in Majorca, no less than in
the exercise of his authority as a magistrate and a minister of state
to Charles the Fourth, and as the head of the government at Seville.
He lived, indeed, in times of great trouble, but his virtues were
equal to the trials that were laid upon them, and when he died, in a
wretched and comfortless inn, he had the consolation of believing that
Spain would be successful in the struggle he had assisted to lead on,
and of knowing, in his own heart, what the Cortes afterwards declared
to the world, that he was “a man well deserving of his country.”<a

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[p. 305]</span></p> <p>One
historical work of the reign of Charles the Fourth should not be
forgotten. It was by Juan Bautista Muñoz, and was undertaken by the
especial order of Charles the Third, who demanded of its author a
complete history of the Spanish discoveries and conquests in America.
This was in 1779. But Muñoz encountered many obstacles. The members of
the Academy of History were not well disposed towards an undertaking,
which seemed to fall within their own jurisdiction; and when he had
finished the first portion, they subjected it, by the royal permission,
to an examination, which, from its length even more than its rigor,
threatened to prevent the work from being printed at all. This,
however, was stopped by a summary order from the king; and the first
volume, bringing down the history to the year 1500, was published in
1793. But no other followed it; and since the death of Muñoz, which
occurred in 1799, when he was fifty-four years old, no attempt has been
made to resume the work. It therefore remains just as he then left
it,—a fragment, written, indeed, in a philosophical spirit and with a
severe simplicity of style, but of small value, because it embraces
so inconsiderable a portion of the subject to which it is devoted.<a
id="FNanchor_361" href="#Footnote_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a></p>

<p>An epic attempt of the same period is of still less importance. It
is “Mexico Conquered,” an heroic poem in twenty-six books, and about
twenty-five thousand lines, beginning with the demand of Cortés,
at Tlascala, to be received in person by Montezuma, and end<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[p. 306]</span>ing with the fall of
Mexico and the capture of Guatimozin. Its author was Escoiquiz, who,
as the tutor of Ferdinand, Prince of Asturias, and his adviser in
the troubles of the Escurial, of Aranjuez, and of Bayonne, showed
an honorable character, which at different times brought upon him
the vengeance of the Prince of the Peace, of Charles the Fourth, of
Bonaparte, and, at last, of Ferdinand himself.</p>

<p>The literary ambition of Escoiquiz, however, is of both an earlier
and later date than this unhappy interval, when his upright spirit was
so tried by political persecutions. In 1797 he published a translation
of Young’s “Night Thoughts”; and, while he was a prisoner in France,
from 1808 to 1814, he prepared a Spanish version of Milton’s “Paradise
Lost,” which showed, at least, with what pleasure he gave himself up to
letters, and what a solace they were to him under his privations and
misfortunes. His “Mexico” was first printed in 1798. It is cast more
carefully into an epic form than were the heroic poems that abounded
in the days of the Philips, and is sustained more than they generally
were by such supernatural Christian machinery as was first used with
effect by Tasso. But, like them, it is not without cold, allegorical
personages, who play parts too important in the action; while, on
the other hand, its faithful history of events, its unity of design,
and its regular proportions, are no sufficient compensation for its
ill-constructed stanzas and its chronicling dulness. The history
of Solís is much more interesting and poetical than this wearisome
romantic epic, which owes to that historian nearly all its facts.<a
id="FNanchor_362" href="#Footnote_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[p. 307]</span></p> <p>Leandro
Moratin, son of the poet who flourished in the reign of Charles the
Third, was, in some respects, a greater sufferer from the convulsions
of the times in which he lived than Escoiquiz, and in all respects more
distinguished in the world of letters. His principal success, however,
was in the drama, where he must hereafter be more fully noticed.
Here, therefore, it is only necessary to say, that, in his lyric and
miscellaneous poetry, he was a follower of his father, modifying his
manner so far under the influence of Conti, an Italian man of letters
who lived long at Madrid, that, in his shorter pieces, the Italian
terseness is quite apparent and gives a finish to the surface, though
the material beneath may be quite Castilian. This is particularly true
of his odes and sonnets, and of a striking Chorus of the Spirits of the
Patriarchs of the Old Testament awaiting the Appearance of the Saviour;
a solemn composition, breathing the fervent spirit of Luis of Granada.
His ballads, on the other hand, though finished with great care, are
more national in their tone than any thing else he has left us. But the
poems that please us best and interest us most are those that show his
own temper and affections; such as his “Epistle to Jovellanos,” and his
“Ode on the Death of Conde,” the historian.</p>

<p>In none of his personal relations, however, does Moratin appear
to such obvious advantage as in the difficult ones in which he stood
at different times with the Prince of the Peace. To that profligate
minister he owed, not only all his means for training himself as a
dramatic writer, but the position in society which insured his success;
and when the day of retribution<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[p.
308]</span> came, and his patron fell, as he deserved to fall, Moratin,
though he suffered in every way from his changed condition and the
persecution of the enemies of the Prince, refused to join their cry
against the crushed favorite. He said truly and nobly, “I was neither
his friend, nor his counsellor, nor his servant; but all that I was I
owed to him; and, although we have now-a-days a convenient philosophy,
which teaches men to receive benefits without gratitude, and, when
circumstances alter, to pay with reproach favors asked and received,
I value my own good opinion too much to seek such infamy.” A person
who acted under the impulse of principles so generous was not made for
success in the reign of Ferdinand the Seventh. It is not remarkable,
therefore, that nearly all the latter part of Moratin’s life was
spent, either voluntarily or involuntarily, in foreign countries,
and that he died at last in want and exile.<a id="FNanchor_363"
href="#Footnote_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a></p>

<p>The last of these miscellaneous writers of the reign of Charles the
Fourth that should be mentioned is Quintana, who, like Jovellanos,
Moratin, and Escoiquiz, suffered much from the violence of the
revolutions through which they all passed, but, unlike them, has
survived to enjoy a serene and honored old age. He was born at Madrid
in 1772, but received the most effective part of his literary education
at Salamanca, where he acknowledged the influence of Melendez and
Cienfuegos. His profession was the law; and he began the serious
business of life in the capital, kindly en<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_309">[p. 309]</span>couraged by Jovellanos. But he preferred
letters; and a small society of intellectual friends, that assembled
every evening at his house, soon stimulated his preference into a
passion. In 1801 he ventured to print his tragedy of “The Duke of
Viseo,” imitated from “The Castle Spectre” of Lewis; and in 1805 he
produced on the stage his “Pelayo,” intended to rouse his countrymen to
a resistance of foreign oppression, by a striking example from their
own history. The former had little success; but the latter, though
written according to the doctrines of the severer school, struck a
chord to which the hearts of the audience gladly answered.</p>

<p>Meantime, between these two attempts, he published, in 1802, a
small volume of poetry, almost entirely lyric, taking the same noble
and patriotic tone he had taken in his successful tragedy, and showing
a spirit more deep and earnest than was to be found in any of the
school of Salamanca, to which, in his address to Melendez, he leaves
no doubt that he now gladly associated himself. In a similar spirit
he published, in 1807, a single volume containing five lives of
distinguished Spaniards, who, like the Cid and the Great Captain, had
successfully fought the enemies of their country at home and abroad;
and almost simultaneously he prepared three volumes of selections from
the best Spanish poets, accompanying them with critical notices, which,
if more slight than might have been claimed from one like Quintana, and
less generous in the praise they bestow than they ought to have been,
are yet national in their temper, and better than any thing else of
their kind in the language. Both show a too willing imitation of the
French manner, and contain occasional Gallicisms; but both are written
in a clear and graceful prose, both were well received, as they<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[p. 310]</span> deserved to be, and
both were, long afterwards, further continued by their accomplished
author; the first by the addition of four important lives, and the last
by extracts from the miscellaneous poets of a later period, and from
several of the best of the elder epics.</p>

<p>But though the taste of Quintana was somewhat inclined to the
literature of France, he was a Spaniard at heart, and a faithful one.
Even before the French invasion he had so carefully kept himself aloof
from the influence and patronage of the Prince of the Peace, that,
though belonging almost strictly to the same school of poetry with
Moratin, these two distinguished men lived at Madrid, imperfectly known
to each other, and in fact as heads of different literary societies,
whose intercourse was not so kindly as it should have been. But the
moment the revolution of 1808 broke out, Quintana sprang to the place
for which he felt himself called. He published at once his effective
“Odes to Emancipated Spain”; he threw out, in the journals of the
time, whatever he thought would excite his countrymen to resist their
invaders; he became the secretary to the Cortes and to the regency;
and he wrote many of the powerful proclamations, manifestos, and
addresses that distinguished so honorably the career of the different
administrations to which he belonged during their struggle for national
independence. In short, he devoted all that he possessed of talent
or fortune to the service of his country in the day of its sorest
trial.</p>

<p>But he was ill rewarded for it. Much of what had been done by the
representatives of the Spanish people in the name of Ferdinand the
Seventh, during his forced detention in France, was unwelcome to
that shortsighted monarch; and, as soon as he returned to Madrid,
in 1814, a persecution was begun of those who<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_311">[p. 311]</span> had most contributed to the adoption
of these unwelcome measures. Among the more obnoxious persons was
Quintana, who was thrown into prison in the fortress of Pamplona,
and remained there six miserable years, interdicted from the use
of writing-materials, and cut off from all intercourse with his
friends. The changes of 1820 unexpectedly released him, and raised
him for a time to greater distinction than he had enjoyed before.
But, three years later, another political revolution took from him
all his employments and influence; and he retired to Estremadura,
where he occupied himself with letters till new changes and the death
of the king restored him to the old public offices he had filled so
well, adding to his former honors that of a peer of the realm. But
from the days when he first attracted public regard by his noble
Odes on the Ocean, and on the beneficent expedition sent to America
with the great charity of Vaccination, letters have been his chosen
employment;—his pride, when he cheered on his countrymen to resist
oppression; his consolation in prison and in exile; his crown of
honor in an honored old age.<a id="FNanchor_364" href="#Footnote_364"

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> most considerable literary movement
of the eighteenth century in Spain, and the one that best marks the
poetical character of the entire period, is that relating to the
theatre, which it was earnestly attempted to subject to the rules then
prevailing on the French stage. Intimations of such a design are found
in the reign of Philip the Fifth, as soon as the War of the Succession
was closed. The Marquis of San Juan began, in 1713, with a translation
of the “Cinna” of Corneille;—the first tragedy under the French rules
that appeared in the Spanish language, and one that was probably
selected for this distinction, because it was well suited to the
condition of a country, that had so much reason to seek the clemency of
its prince in favor of many distinguished persons, whom the civil war
had led to resist his power.<a id="FNanchor_365" href="#Footnote_365"
class="fnanchor">[365]</a> But it was never rep<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_313">[p. 313]</span>resented, and was soon forgotten.
Cañizares, the last of the elder race of dramatists that showed any
of the old spirit, yielded more than once to the new school of taste,
and regarded his “Sacrifice of Iphigenia”—an absurd play, for which
the “Iphigénie” of Racine is very little responsible—as an imitation
of the French school.<a id="FNanchor_366" href="#Footnote_366"
class="fnanchor">[366]</a> Neither these, however, nor plays of an
irregular and often vulgar cast, like those written by Diego de Torres,
professor of natural philosophy, by Lobo, the military officer, and
by Salvo, the tailor, obtained any permanent favor, or were able to
constitute foundations on which to reconstruct a national drama. As far
as any thing was heard on the public stage worthy of its pretensions,
it was the works of the old masters and of their poor imitators,
Cañizares and Zamora.<a id="FNanchor_367" href="#Footnote_367"
class="fnanchor">[367]</a></p>

<p>The Spanish theatre, in fact, was now at its lowest ebb, and
wholly in the hands of the populace, from whom it had always received
much of its character, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[p.
314]</span> who had been its faithful friends in the days of its trial
and adversity. Nor could its present condition fairly claim a higher
patronage. All Spanish plays acted for public amusement in Madrid were
still represented, as they had been in the seventeenth century, in
open court-yards, with galleries or corridors that surrounded them. To
these court-yards there was no covering except in case of a shower,
and then the awning stretched over them was so imperfect, that, if the
rain continued, and those of the spectators who were always compelled
to stand during the performance were too numerous to find shelter under
the projecting seats of the corridors, the exhibition was broken up
for the day, and the crowd driven home. There was hardly any pretence
of scenery; the performance always took place in the day-time; and the
price of admission, which was collected in money at the door, did not
exceed a few farthings for each spectator.</p>

<p>The second queen of Philip the Fifth, Isabel Farnese, who had been
used to the enjoyment of all kinds of scenic exhibitions in Italy,
was not satisfied with this state of things. Finding an ill-arranged
theatre, in which an Italian company had sometimes acted, she caused
material additions to be made to it, and required regular operas to be
brought out for her amusement from 1737. The change was an important
one. The two old court-yards took the alarm. First one and then the
other began to erect a new and more commodious structure for theatrical
entertainments; and as they had been each other’s rivals for a century
and a half in the awkwardness of their arrangements, no less than in
their claims for public patronage, so now they became rivals in a
struggle for improvement. Under such impulses, the new “Theatre of the
Cross” was finished in 1743, and that of “The Prince,” in 1745.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[p. 315]</span>But, in most
respects, there was little change. True to the traditions of their
origin, the new structures were still called court-yards, and their
boxes, rooms;—the <i>cazuela</i>, or “stewpan,” was still kept for the
women, who sat there veiled like nuns, but acting very little as if
they were such;—the Alcalde de Corte, or Judge of the Municipality,
still appeared in the proscenium, with his two clerks behind him, to
keep the peace or bear record to its breach;—Semiramis wore a hooped
petticoat and high-heeled shoes, and Julius Cæsar was assassinated
in a curled periwig and velvet court coat, with a feathered Spanish
hat under his arm. The old spirit, therefore, it is plain, prevailed,
however great might be the improvements made in the external
arrangements and architecture of the theatres.</p>

<p>One cause of this was the exclusive favor shown to the opera by two
Italian queens, and encouraged by the new political relations of Spain
with Italy. The theatre of the Buen Retiro, where Calderon had so often
triumphed, was fitted up with unwonted magnificence, by Farinelli,
the first singer of his time, who had been brought to the Spanish
court in order to soothe the melancholy of Philip the Fifth, and who
still continued there, enjoying the especial protection of Ferdinand
the Sixth. Luzan translated Metastasio’s “Clemency of Titus” for the
opening of the new and gorgeous saloon in 1747; and both then, and
for a considerable period afterwards, all that the resources of the
court could command in poetry and music, or in the show and pomp of
theatrical machinery, was lavished on an exotic, which at last failed
to take healthy root in the soil of the country.<a id="FNanchor_368"
href="#Footnote_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a></p> <p><span
class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[p. 316]</span></p> <p>Meantime the
national theatre, neglected by the court and the higher classes, was
given up to such writers as Francisco de Castro, an actor who sought
the applause of the lowest part of his audience by vulgar farces,<a
id="FNanchor_369" href="#Footnote_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a>
and Thomas de Añorbe, the chaplain of a nunnery at Madrid, whose
“Paolino,” announced as “in the French fashion,” provoked the just
ridicule of Luzan, and whose “Virtue conquers Fate,” if no less
extravagant, has the merit of being an attack on astrology and a belief
in planetary influences.<a id="FNanchor_370" href="#Footnote_370"
class="fnanchor">[370]</a> With the success of such absurdities,
however, scholars and men of taste seem to have grown desperate.
Montiano, a Biscayan gentleman, high in office at court, and a member
of the Academy of Good Taste, that met at the house of the Countess
of Lemos, led the way in an attack upon them. He began, in 1750, with
a tragedy on the Roman story of Virginia, which he intended should
be a model for Spanish serious theatrical compositions, and which he
accompanied with a long and well-written discourse, showing how far
Bermudez, Cueva, Virues, and a few more of the old masters, had been
willing to be governed by doctrines similar to his own.</p>

<p>The tragedy itself, which comes like a sort of appendix to this
discussion, and seems intended to illustrate and enforce its opinions,
is entirely after the model of the French school, and especially after
Racine;—all the rules, as they are technically called, including
that which requires the stage never to be left vacant during<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[p. 317]</span> the continuance of
an act, being rigorously observed. But the “Virginia” is no less
cold than it is regular, and, like the waters of the Alps, its very
purity betrays the frozen region from which it has descended. Its
versification, which consists of unrhymed iambics, is as far as
possible removed from the warmth and freedom of the ballad style in the
elder drama; its whole movement is languid; and the catastrophe, from
the fear of shocking the spectator by a show of blood on the stage,
turns out, in fact, to be no catastrophe at all. No effort, it is
believed, was made to bring it upon the stage, and as a printed poem it
produced no real effect on public opinion.</p>

<p>Montiano, however, was not discouraged. In 1753 he published another
critical discourse and another tragedy, with similar merits and similar
defects, taking for its subject the reign and death of Athaulpho, the
Goth, as they are found in the old chronicles. But this, too, like
its predecessor, was never acted, and both are now rarely read.<a
id="FNanchor_371" href="#Footnote_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a></p>

<p>The earliest comedy within the French rules that ap<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[p. 318]</span>peared in the
Spanish language was the translation of Lachaussée’s “Préjugé à
la Mode” by Luzan, which was printed in 1751.<a id="FNanchor_372"
href="#Footnote_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a> It judiciously
preserved the national <i>asonantes</i>, or imperfect rhymes, throughout,
and was followed, in 1754, by the “Athalie” of Racine, rendered with
much taste, principally into blank verse, by Llaguno y Amirola,
Secretary of the Academy of History. But the first <i>original</i> Spanish
comedy formed on French models was the “Petimetra,” or the Female
Fribble, by Moratin the elder. It was printed in 1762, and was preceded
by a dissertation, in which, while the merits of the schools of Lope
and Calderon are imperfectly acknowledged, their defects are exhibited
in the strongest relief, and the impression left, in relation to the
old masters, is of the most unfavorable character.</p>

<p>In the play itself, a similar kind of deference is shown to the
popular prejudices and feelings, which adhered faithfully to the
old drama and to the miserable imitations of it that continued to
be produced. It is divided into the three <i>jornadas</i> to which the
public had so long been wonted, and is written in the national manner,
sometimes with full rhymes, and sometimes only with <i>asonantes</i>. But
the compromise was not accepted by those to whom it was offered. The
principal character, Doña Gerónima, is feebly drawn; and, though the
versification and style are always easy, and sometimes beautiful, the
attempt to reconcile the irregular genius of the elder comedy with what
Moratin, on his title-page, calls “the rigor of art” was a failure.
A corresponding effort which he made the next year in tragedy,<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[p. 319]</span> taking the story of
Lucretia for his subject, and adopting even more fully the French
conventions, was not more successful. Neither of them obtained the
distinction of being publicly represented.</p>

<p>That honor, however, was gained in 1770, with much difficulty, by
Moratin’s “Hormesinda,” the first original drama, under the canons that
governed Corneille and Racine, which ever appeared in a public theatre
in Spain. It is founded on events connected with the Arab invasion and
the achievements of Pelayo, and is written, like the “Lucretia,” in
that irregular verse, partly rhymed and partly not, which in Spanish
poetry is called <i>silva</i>, and is intended to have, more than any other,
the air of improvisation.</p>

<p>The partial success of this drama, which, notwithstanding an
improbable plot, deserved all the favor it received, induced its
author, in 1777, to write his third tragedy, “Guzman the True,”
dedicating it to his patron, the Duke of Medina-Sidonia, who was a
descendant of that famous nobleman, and who, a few years before,
had himself translated the “Iphigénie” of Racine into Spanish. The
well-known character of the hero, who chose rather to have his son
sacrificed by the Moors than to surrender the fortress of Tarifa, if
it is not drawn with the vigor of the old Castilian chronicles or of
the drama of Guevara, is exhibited, at least, with a well-sustained
consistency, that gives token of more poetical power than any thing
else produced by its author for the theatre. But this is its only real
merit; and the last tragedy of Moratin was, on the whole, no more
successful, and no more deserving of success, than the first.</p>

<p>Cadahalso, the friend whom we have already noticed as much under
the influence of Moratin, went one step<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_320">[p. 320]</span> further in his imitation of the French
masters. His “Don Sancho Garcia,” a regular, but feeble, tragedy,
printed in 1771 and afterwards acted, is written in long lines and
rhymed couplets; an innovation which could hardly fail to be accounted
monotonous on a stage, one of whose chief luxuries had so long been
a wild variety of measures. Nor did more favor follow an attempt
of Sebastian y Latre to adjust to the theories of the time two old
dramas, still often represented,—the one by Roxas and the other by
Moreto,—which he forced within the pale of the three unities, and for
the public representations of one of which, Aranda, the minister of
state, paid the charges. Like the subsequent attempts of Trigueros
to accommodate some of Lope de Vega’s plays to the same system of
opinions, it was entirely unsuccessful. The difference between the two
different schools was so great, and the effort to force them together
so violent, that enough of the spirit and grace of the originals
could not be found in these modernized imitations to satisfy the
demands of any audience that could be collected to listen to them.<a
id="FNanchor_373" href="#Footnote_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[p. 321]</span></p> <p>Yriarte,
better known as a didactic poet and fabulist, enjoys the distinction
of having produced the first regular original <i>comedy</i> that was
publicly represented in Spain. He began very young, with a play which
he did not afterwards think fit to place among his collected works;
and, beside translations from Voltaire and Destouches, and three or
four attempts of less consequence, he wrote two full-length original
comedies, which were better than any thing previously produced by
the school to which he belonged. One of them, called “The Flattered
Youth,” appeared in 1778, and the other, “The Ill-bred Miss,” ten
years later;—the first being on the subject of a son spoiled by a
foolishly indulgent mother, and the second on the daughter of a rich
man equally spoiled by the carelessness and neglect of her father. Both
are divided into three acts, and written in the imperfect rhyme and
short verses always grateful to Castilian ears; and both are marked by
good character-drawing and a pleasant, easy manner, not abounding in
wit nor sensibly deficient in it. But, except these plays of Yriarte
and Moratin, and an unfortunate one by Melendez Valdes in 1784,—founded
on Camacho’s wedding, in “Don Quixote,” and containing occasionally
gentle and pleasing pastoral poetry which ill agrees with the rude
jesting of Sancho,—nothing that deserves notice was done for comedy in
the latter part of the reign of Charles the Third.<a id="FNanchor_374"
href="#Footnote_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a></p>

<p>Tragedy fared still worse. The “Numantia Destroyed,” written by
Ayala, a man of learning and the regular censor of the public theatres
of Madrid, was acted in 1775. Its subject is the same with that
of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[p. 322]</span> the “Numantia”
by Cervantes; but the horrors of the siege it describes are not brought
home to the sympathies of the reader by instances of individual
suffering, as they are in the elder dramatist, and therefore produce
much less effect. As an acting drama, however, it is not without merit.
Its versification, which is, again, an attempt at a compromise with
the public by giving alternate <i>asonantes</i>, but attaching them to the
long-drawn lines of the French theatre, is not, indeed, fortunate;
but the style is otherwise rich and vigorous, and the tone elevated.
Perhaps its ardent expressions of patriotic feeling, and its fierce
denunciations of foreign oppression, have done as much to keep it on
the stage as its intrinsic poetical merits.</p>

<p>The “Raquel” of Huerta, printed in 1778, three years after the
“Numantia,” is not so creditable to the author, and produced a less
lasting impression on the public. The story—that of the Jewess of
Toledo, which has been so often treated by Spanish poets—is taken
too freely from a play of Diamante; and though Huerta has, in some
respects, given the materials he found there a better arrangement,
and a more grave and sonorous versification, he has diminished the
spirit and naturalness of the action by constraining it within the hard
conventions he prescribed to himself, and has rendered the whole drama
so uninteresting, that, notwithstanding its considerable reputation at
first, it was soon forgotten.<a id="FNanchor_375" href="#Footnote_375"
class="fnanchor">[375]</a></p>

<p>The first real success of any thing in the French style on the
Spanish stage, though not in the classical forms prescribed by Boileau
and Racine, was obtained by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[p.
323]</span> Jovellanos. Early in life he had ventured a tragedy,
entitled “Pelayo,” in the same measure with Ayala’s “Numantia,” and on
nearly the same subject with the “Hormesinda” of the elder Moratin.
But the philosophical statesman, though he wrote good lyric verse, was
not a tragic poet. He was, however, something better;—he was a really
good man, and his philanthropy led him, in 1773, to write his “Honored
Culprit,” a play, intended to rebuke the cruel and unavailing severity
of the laws of his country against duelling, as they then existed. It
is a sentimental comedy in the manner of Diderot’s “Natural Son”; and,
beside that it has the honor of being the first attempt of the kind on
the Spanish stage, it has that of being more fortunate than any of its
successors. The story on which it is founded is that of a gentleman,
who, after repeatedly refusing a challenge, kills, in a secret duel,
the infamous husband of the lady he afterwards marries; and, being
subsequently led to confess his crime in order to save a friend, who is
arrested as the guilty party, he is condemned to death by a rigorous
judge, who unexpectedly turns out to be his own father, and is saved
from execution, but not from severe punishment, only by the royal
clemency.</p>

<p>How many opportunities for scenes of the most painful interest
such a story affords is obvious at the first glance. Jovellanos has
used them skilfully, because he has done it in the simplest and most
direct manner, with great warmth of kindly feeling, and in a style
whose idiomatic purity is not the least of its attractions. “The
Honored Culprit,” therefore, was at once successful, and when well
acted, though its poetical power is small, it can hardly be listened
to without tears. It was first produced in one of the royal theatres,
without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[p. 324]</span> the
knowledge of its author; then, spreading throughout Spain, it was
acted at Cadiz at the same time both in French and Spanish, and, at
last, became familiar on the stages of France and Germany. Such wide
success had long been unknown to any thing in Spanish literature.<a
id="FNanchor_376" href="#Footnote_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a></p>

<p>But from the time when the first attempt was made to introduce
regular plays in the French manner upon the Spanish stage, an active
contest had been going on, which, though the advantage had of late
been on the side of the innovators, did not seem likely to be soon
determined. In 1762, Moratin the elder published what he called “The
Truth told about the Spanish Stage”;—three spirited pamphlets, in
which he attacked the old drama generally, but above all the <i>autos
sacramentales</i>, not denying the poetical merit of those by Calderon,
but declaring that such wild, coarse, and blasphemous exhibitions,
as they generally were, ought not to be tolerated in a civilized and
religious community. So far as the <i>autos</i> were concerned, Moratin was
successful. They were prohibited by a royal edict, June 17, 1765; and
though, even in the nineteenth century, it can hardly be said that they
have been entirely driven out of the villages, where they have been the
delight of the mass of the people from a period before that of Alfonso
the Wise, yet in Madrid and the larger cities of Spain they have
never been heard since they were first forbidden.<a id="FNanchor_377"
href="#Footnote_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a></p> <p><span
class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[p. 325]</span></p> <p>But this was as
far as Moratin could prevail. In the public secular theatre, generally,
his poetry and wit produced no effect. There, two riotous parties in
the two audiences of Madrid—distinguishing themselves by favors worn
in their hats and led on by vulgar friars and rude mechanics, making
up in spirit what they wanted in decency, and readily uniting to urge
an open war against all further innovations—effectually prevented any
of the regular dramas that were written from being represented in
their presence, until 1770. The old masters they partly tolerated;
especially Calderon, Moreto, and the dramatists of the latter part of
the seventeenth century; but the popular favorites were Ibañez, Lobera,
Vicente Guerrero, a play-actor, Julian de Castro, who wrote ballads
for the street beggars and died in a hospital, and others of the same
class; all as vulgar as the populace they delighted.</p>

<p>After Aranda ceased to be minister, in 1773, this state of things
was somewhat modified, without being materially improved. Under his
administration, the theatres in the royal residences had been opened
for tragedy and comedy; and translations from the French had been
acted before the court in a manner suited to their subjects. The two
popular theatres of the capital, too, had not escaped his regard,
and under his influence had been provided with better scenery; and,
from 1768, gave representations in the evening.<a id="FNanchor_378"
href="#Footnote_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a></p>

<p>Still, every thing was in a very low state. A blacksmith was
the reigning critic to be consulted by those<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_326">[p. 326]</span> who sought a hearing on either stage,
and the more regular plays, whether translations that had been acted
with success at court, or tragedies and comedies of the poets already
noticed, made a strange confusion with those of the old masters, which
were still sometimes heard, and those of the favorites of the mob,
whose works prevailed over all others in the theatrical repertories and
in the general regard. But, whatever might be produced and performed,
the intervals between the acts, and much time before and after the
principal piece, were filled up with <i>tonadillas</i>, <i>seguidillas</i>,
ballads, and all the forms of <i>entremeses</i>, <i>saynetes</i>, and dances,
that had been common in the last century or invented in the present
one,—an act in a serious and poetical play being sometimes divided,
in order to give place to one or another of them, and gratify an
audience that seemed to grow more and more impatient of every thing
except popular farce.<a id="FNanchor_379" href="#Footnote_379"
class="fnanchor">[379]</a></p>

<p>In this confusion of the old and the new,—of what was stiff, formal,
and foreign with what was rudest and most lawless in the national drama
at home,—a single writer appeared, who, from the mere force of natural
talent, fell instinctively into a tone not unworthy of the theatre,
and yet one that obtained for him a degree of favor long denied to
persons of more poetical accomplishments. This was Ramon de la Cruz, a
gentleman of family and an officer of the government at Madrid, who was
born in 1731, and from 1765 to the time of his death, at the end of the
century, constantly amused the audiences of the capital with dramas,
written in any form likely to please at the palace, on the public
stages of the city, or in the houses of the nobility, who, like the
Duchess<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[p. 327]</span> of Ossuna,
or Aranda, the minister of state, were able to indulge in such a luxury
at home.</p>

<p>In the whole, he wrote about three hundred dramatic compositions,
but printed less than a third of that number; most of those he
published being farces designed to produce a merely popular effect.
They fill ten volumes, and are all in the short, national measure
of the old drama, mingled occasionally, though rarely, with other
forms of verse. They bear, however, very different names; some of
them characteristic and some of them not. A few he calls “Dramatic
Caprices”; apparently because no more definite title would be suited
to their undefined character. Some he calls “<i>Saynetes</i> to be sung,”
and some “Burlesque Tragedies.” Others have no names at all, not even
for their personages, except those of the actors who represented the
different parts. While yet others pass under the old designations of
<i>loas</i>, <i>entremeses</i>, and <i>zarzuelas</i>, though often with a character
which it would have been impossible for the early representations
bearing the same names to assume. Occasionally, as in the case of the
“Clementina,” he takes pains to observe all the rules of the French
drama; but they sit very uneasily upon him, and he seldom submits to
them. His great merit is almost entirely confined to his short farces;
and therefore, when Duran, to whom the Spanish theatre owes so much,
undertook to publish what was best of the works of La Cruz, he rejected
all the rest, and, taking his materials both from manuscript sources
and from what had been already published, gives us merely a hundred and
ten proper “Saynetes.”</p>

<p>Their subjects are various, and they are very unequal in length;
but, amidst all their varieties, one principle gave them a prevailing
character and insured their suc<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[p.
328]</span>cess. They are founded on the manners of the middling and
lower classes of the city, which they reflect freshly and faithfully,
whether their materials are sought in the <i>tertulias</i> or evening
parties of persons in a decent condition of life, where the demure
<i>Abate</i> and the authorized lover of the mistress of the house contend
for influence; or in the trim walks of the Prado, and among the
loungers of the Puerta del Sol, where the fashion of the court is
jostled by the humors of the people; or in the <i>Lavapies</i> and the
<i>Maravillas</i>, where the lowest classes, with their picturesque dresses
and unchanging manners, reign supreme and unquestioned. But, under
all circumstances and in all situations, Ramon de la Cruz, in this
class of his dramas, is attractive and amusing; and, though there is
seldom any thought of dramatic skill in his combinations, and often no
attempt at a catastrophe,—though his style is any thing but correct,
and he is wholly careless of finish in his versification,—yet his
farces so abound in wit and faithful delineations of character, they
are so true to the manners they intend to represent, and so entirely
national in their tone, that they seem expressly made for a pleasant
and appropriate accompaniment to the longer dramas of Lope and
Calderon, in whose popular spirit they are most successfully written.<a
id="FNanchor_380" href="#Footnote_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[p. 329]</span></p>
<p>Meanwhile the press was not so inactive as it had been. Sedano
published his “Jael,” taken from the story in the book of Judges;
Lassala his “Iphigenia”; Trigueros his “Tradesmen of Madrid”; and
Cortés his “Atahualpa”; the last two having been written, and
successful, at the same festivities of 1784 for which Melendez composed
his “Marriage of Camacho,” and failed. Cienfuegos, too, a poet of more
original power than either of them, wrote his “Pitaco,” which opened
for him the doors of the Spanish Academy; his “Idomeneo,” from which,
in imitation of Alfieri, he excluded the passion of love; and his
“Countess of Castile,” and his “Zoraida,” taken from the old traditions
of his country’s wars and feuds; each giving proof of talent, but of
talent rather lyric than dramatic, and each showing too anxious an
adherence to Greek models, which were particularly unsuitable for
the Zoraida, whose scene is laid in the gardens of the Alhambra.<a
id="FNanchor_381" href="#Footnote_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a> But
all of them—so far at least as the public stage is concerned—have been
long since forgotten.</p>

<p>On the other hand, La Huerta, in 1785, published fourteen volumes
of the old full-length plays, and one volume of the old “Entremeses”;
a work intended to vindicate the national theatre of Spain in the
preceding century, and to place it as high as that of the rest of
Europe, or higher. But he was ill fitted for his task. A selection,
designed to illustrate the great masters of the Spanish stage, which,
to say nothing of other mistakes, wholly omitted Lope de Vega, began
with a capital defect; and this circumstance, together with the<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[p. 330]</span> arrogant tone of the
editor in his Prefaces, and the contradiction to his present opinions
afforded by the example of his own “Raquel,” which is entirely in the
French manner, and to his translations of the “Electra” of Sophocles
and the “Zaïre” of Voltaire, which were obviously made to defend the
French school, prevented his “Teatro Hespañol” from producing the
effect that might otherwise have followed its not ill-timed appearance.
Still it was a work of consequence, and was afterwards acknowledged
to be such by the public.<a id="FNanchor_382" href="#Footnote_382"
class="fnanchor">[382]</a></p>

<p>The discussions it provoked were of more direct importance, and
tended to infuse new life into the theatre itself. Such discussions
had been begun immediately after the publication of the first tragedy
by Montiano, in 1750,—a date which may be regarded as the dividing
point in the history of the Spanish stage during the eighteenth
century,—and they were now resumed with great activity, partly in
consequence of the increasing interest in the national drama generally,
and partly in consequence of the personal temper of La Huerta himself.
One immediate result of this state of things was a great increase in
the number of plays, of which at least ten times more were written
in the last half of the century than in the first; and if there
were less improvement in the condition of the theatre than<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[p. 331]</span> might have been
anticipated from such competition, still, as we have seen, poets and
men of genius, like Ramon de la Cruz, were stirred by the movement, and
far-sighted spirits, like Jovellanos, augured well for the future.<a
id="FNanchor_383" href="#Footnote_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a></p>

<p>The great obstacle to the success of better dramas lay in a number
of writers, who pandered to the bad taste of the low and vulgar
audiences of their time. Among the more prominent and successful of
these were Valladares and Zavala. The first wrote above a hundred
dramas on all kinds of subjects, tragic and comic, prefixing to his
“Emperor Albert” a discourse in the spirit of Huerta, to defend the
Spanish drama from the attacks of its French neighbours. The other,
Zavala, wrote about half as many, some of which, like his “Victims of
Love,” are in the sentimental style, while others, like three on the
history of Charles the Twelfth of Sweden, are as extravagant as any
thing in the worst of the dramatists he sought to imitate. Both used
the old versification, and intended to humor the public taste in its
demands for a vulgar and extravagant drama; though occasionally, as
in “The Triumphs of Love and Friendship,” by Zavala, they wrote in
prose; and occasionally, as in “The Defence of Virtue,” they showed
themselves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[p. 332]</span> willing
to submit to the rules of the French stage. In fact, they had neither
poetical principles nor poetical talent, and wrote only to amuse a
populace more ignorant and rude than themselves.</p>

<p>Somewhat better than either of these last, and certainly more
successful than either with the better classes of his contemporaries,
was Comella. Like Valladares, his fertility was great; and the
ease with which he wrote, and the ingenuity with which he invented
new and striking situations, seemed to have the same charm for his
audiences which they had had for the audiences of Lope and Calderon.
But, unhappily, Comella had not the genius of the old masters. His
plots are as involved, and sometimes as interesting, as theirs; but,
generally, they are, to a most extravagant degree, wild and absurd.
Even when he deals with subjects as well known as Christina of Sweden,
Louis the Fourteenth, and Frederic the Great, he seems to have no
regard for truth, probability, or consistency. His versification,
too, is unfortunate. In form it is, indeed, such as had always been
insisted on where the popular voice of Castile has borne sway; but it
lacks variety, as well as richness and strength. Still, his romances
in dialogue were found so interesting, and there was so much of
tender and honorable feeling in the tone of his sentiments and the
incidents of his plots, that above a hundred of his wild dramas—some
of them in prose, but more in verse, some on historical subjects,
but many made out of love-stories of his own invention—were received
with applause, and proved more profitable to the theatres of Madrid
than any thing else they could offer to the multitude on whom they
depended for their existence.<a id="FNanchor_384" href="#Footnote_384"
class="fnanchor">[384]</a></p> <p><span class="pagenum"
id="Page_333">[p. 333]</span></p> <p>But while Comella was at the
height of his reputation, a formidable antagonist, both to himself and
to the whole class of writers he represented, appeared in the person of
Moratin the younger, son of that poet who first produced on the Spanish
stage an original drama written according to the French doctrines. He
was born in 1760. To insure for the child a subsistence he had with
difficulty earned for himself, his father placed him as an apprentice
to a jeweller, at whose trade the young man continued to work till he
was twenty-three years old,—the latter part of the time in order to
support his mother, who had been left a widow.</p>

<p>But his natural disposition for poetry was too strong to be
controlled by the hard circumstances of his situation. When seven years
old he had written verses, and at eighteen he obtained the second
prize offered by the Royal Spanish Academy for a poem to commemorate
the taking of Granada,—a circumstance which astonished nobody more
than it did his own family, for he had written it secretly, and
presented it under a feigned name. Another success of the same sort,
two years later, attracted more attention to the poor young jeweller;
and at last, in 1787, by the kind intervention of Jovellanos, he was
made secretary to the Spanish embassy at Paris, and accompanied the
ambassador, Count Cabarrus, to that capital. There he remained two
years, and, during that time, became acquainted with Goldoni, and
entered into relations with other men of letters, that determined the
direction of his life and the character of his drama.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[p. 334]</span></p>

<p>On his return to Madrid, he obtained the patronage of Don Manuel
Godoy, afterwards the all-powerful Prince of the Peace; and from this
moment his fortune seemed certain. He was sent, at the public charge,
to study the theatres of Germany and England, as well as those of Italy
and France; he had pensions and places given him at home; and, while
an honorable occupation in the department of Foreign Affairs, which
awaited his return, insured him a distinguished position in society, he
had still leisure left for that cultivation of letters which he prized
above all his prosperity and all his official honors.</p>

<p>This happy state of things continued till the French invasion of
1808. His public relations then became a misfortune. The flood of
events swept him from his place, as it did his patron; and, without
becoming in any degree false to the interests of his country, he was so
far implicated in those of the new government, that, when Ferdinand the
Seventh was restored to the throne, Moratin was treated for a time with
great rigor. But this, too, passed away, and he was again protected
and favored. Still he suffered. His friends were in exile, and he
felt solitary without them. He went back to France, and, though once
afterwards he returned with a fond longing to the land of his birth, he
found every thing so changed by the triumphant despotism, that it was
no longer Spain to him, and he established himself finally at Paris,
where he died in 1828. He was buried near Molière, whom in life he had
honored and imitated.</p>

<p>When Moratin began his career as a dramatic poet, he found obstacles
to his success on every side. His father’s tragedy of “Hormesinda”
had been produced on the stage only in consequence of the ministerial
pro<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[p. 335]</span>tection
of the Count of Aranda, and in opposition to the judgment and
fears of the actors.<a id="FNanchor_385" href="#Footnote_385"
class="fnanchor">[385]</a> Cienfuegos, who had followed his example,
was able with difficulty to obtain a hearing for two out of his five
dramas;—one of them being listened to with partial favor because it
was on a subject familiar to all Spaniards from the days of the old
ballads, and always welcome to their hearts. Quintana, whose name was
early respected and his influence uniformly great, had failed with “The
Duke of Viseo.” Others were discouraged by such examples, and made no
effort to obtain the public notice where there was so little prospect
of success.</p>

<p>This was the condition of the stage, when the younger Moratin
appeared as a candidate before the audiences of Madrid. The new school
had gained some ground, and the living representatives of the old
one were none of them more distinguished than Comella; but the taste
of the public was not changed, and the managers of the theatre were
obliged, as well as inclined, to yield to its authority and humor its
fancies.</p>

<p>Moratin determined, however, to tread in the footsteps of his
father, for whose example and memory he always felt the sincerest
reverence. He therefore wrote his first comedy, “The Old Husband and
the Young Wife,” quite within the rules, finishing every part of it
with the greatest exactness, but dividing it, as the old Spanish
plays were divided, into three acts, and using throughout the old
short verse which was always popular. But when, in 1786, he offered
his comedy for representation, the simplicity of the action, so
unlike the involved plots on which the common people still loved to
exercise their extraordinary ingenuity, and the<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_336">[p. 336]</span> very quietness and decorum that reigned
throughout it, made the actors alarmed for its success. Objections
were made, and these, with other untoward circumstances, prevented it
from being brought out for four years. When it finally appeared, it
was received with a moderate applause, which satisfied neither of the
extreme parties into which the audiences at Madrid were then divided,
and yet was not perhaps unjust to the comedy, whose action is somewhat
cold and languid, though its poetical merits, in other respects, are
far from being inconsiderable.</p>

<p>But, whatever may have been the effect on the public, the effect on
its author was decisive. He had been heard. His merit had been, in part
at least, acknowledged; and he now determined to bring the pretensions
of the popular dramatists, who were disgracing the stage, to the test
of a public trial on the stage itself. For this purpose, he wrote his
“New Play,” as he called it, which is an exposition of the motives
of a penniless author for composing one of the noisy, extravagant
dramas then constantly acted with applause, and an account of its
first representation;—the whole related by the author himself and his
friends, in a coffee-house contiguous to the theatre, at the very
moment the fatal representation is supposed to be going on.</p>

<p>It is in two acts; and the catastrophe—which consists of the
confusion of the author and his family at the failure of his
performance—is brought on with skill, and with an effect much greater
than the simplicity of the action had promised. The piece, therefore,
was received with a favor which even Moratin and his friends had not
anticipated. The poet, who is its victim, was recognized at once to
be Comella. Some of the inferior characters, whether justly or not,
were ap<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">[p. 337]</span>propriated
to other persons who figured at the time, and the “New Play” was
acknowledged to be a brilliant satire;—severe indeed, but well merited
and happily applied. From this time, therefore, which was 1792,
Moratin, notwithstanding the exasperated opposition of the adherents
of the old school, had secured for himself a permanent place on the
national stage, and, what is more remarkable, this little drama,
almost without a regular action and founded on interests purely
local, was, for the sake of its wit and originality, translated and
successfully represented both in France and Italy.<a id="FNanchor_386"
href="#Footnote_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a></p>

<p>“The Baron,” which is in two acts and in verse, was at first
prepared to be sung; and, without the permission of the author, was
altered to an acting drama and performed in public during his absence
from Spain. On his return, he improved it by material additions, and
produced it again in 1803. It is the least effective of his theatrical
performances; but it triumphed over a cabal, which supported a drama
written on the same subject and represented at the same time, in order
to interfere with its success.</p>

<p>At the moment Moratin was making arrangements for bringing out “The
Baron,” he was occupied with the careful preparation of another comedy
in verse, that was destined still further to increase his reputation.
This was “The Female Hypocrite,” which was written as early as 1791,
and was soon afterwards represented in private, but which was not
finished and acted publicly till 1804. It is an excellent specimen of
character<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">[p. 338]</span>-drawing;
the two principal personages being a girl, made, by the severity of her
family, to assume the appearance of being very religious, while her
cousin, who is well contrasted with her, is rendered frank and winning
by an opposite treatment. The very subject, however, was one that
brought Moratin upon dangerous ground, and his play was forbidden by
the Inquisition. But that once formidable body was now little more than
an engine of state; so that the authority of the Prince of the Peace
was not only sufficient to prevent any disagreeable consequences to
Moratin himself, but was able soon afterwards to indulge the public in
a pleasure for which they were only the more eager, because it had for
a time been interdicted.</p>

<p>Moratin’s last original effort on the stage was a full-length prose
comedy in three acts, which he called the “Little Girl’s Consent,” and
which was acted in 1806. Its general movement is extremely natural, and
yet it is enlivened with a little of the intrigue and bustle that were
always so much liked on the Spanish theatre. A young girl, while in the
course of her education at a convent, becomes attached to a handsome
officer of dragoons. Her mother, ignorant of this, undertakes to bring
her home and marry her to an excellent, benevolent old gentleman,
whom the daughter has never seen, but whom, out of mere weakness, she
has been unable to refuse. At an inn on the road, where the younger
lover falls in with them on purpose to break up this match, they all
meet; and he discovers, to his dismay, that his rival is an uncle to
whom he is sincerely attached, and to whom he owes many obligations.
The mistakes and intrigues of the night they pass together at this
inn give great life to the action, and are full of humor; while the
disinterested attachment of the young lovers<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_339">[p. 339]</span> to each other, and the benevolence of the
uncle, add to the conflicting claims and relations of the different
parties a charm quite original in itself, and very effective in its
exhibition. The play ends by the discovery of the real state of the
daughter’s heart, and the renunciation of all the pretensions of the
uncle, who makes his nephew his heir.</p>

<p>Nothing on the Spanish stage had been so well received for a long
period. It was acted twenty-six nights successively to audiences who
were in the habit of demanding novelties constantly; and then it was
stopped only because Lent came to shut up the theatres. No criticism
appeared except to praise it. The triumph of Moratin was complete.</p>

<p>But he was not destined long to enjoy it. The troubles of his
country were already begun, and in three years the French were its
temporary masters. He prepared, indeed, afterwards two spirited
translations from Molière, with alterations that made them more
attractive to his countrymen; one from the “École des Maris,” which
was acted in 1812, and the other from the “Médecin Malgré Lui,”
which was acted in 1814; but, except these and an unfortunate prose
version of Shakspeare’s “Hamlet,” which was printed in 1798, but never
performed, he wrote nothing for the theatre except the five comedies
already noticed. These, if they form no very broad foundation for his
fame, seem yet to constitute one on which it may rest safely; and, if
they have failed to educate a school strong enough to drive out the
bad imitations of the old masters that have constantly pressed upon
them, have yet been able to keep their own place, little disturbed by
the changes of the times.<a id="FNanchor_387" href="#Footnote_387"
class="fnanchor">[387]</a></p> <p><span class="pagenum"
id="Page_340">[p. 340]</span></p> <p>That the Spanish drama, during the
century which elapsed between the establishment of the House of Bourbon
on the throne and the temporary expulsion of that house from Spain by
the arms of Bonaparte, had, in some respects, made progress, cannot be
doubted. More convenient and suitable structures for its exhibitions
had been erected, not only in the capital, but in all the principal
cities of the kingdom. New and various forms of dramatic composition
had been introduced, which, if not always consistent with the demands
of the national genius, nor often encouraged by the general favor,
had still been welcome to the greater part of the more cultivated
classes, and served both to excite attention to the fallen state of the
theatre generally, and to stir the thoughts of men for its restoration.
Actors, too, of extraordinary merit had from time to time appeared,
like Damian de Castro, for whom Zamora and Cañizares wrote parts;
Maria L’ Advenant, who delighted Signorelli in the higher characters
of Calderon and Moreto; the Tirana, whose tragic powers astonished the
practised taste of Cumberland, the English dramatist; and Maiquez,
who enjoyed the friendship and admiration of nearly all the Spanish
men of letters in his time.<a id="FNanchor_388" href="#Footnote_388"
class="fnanchor">[388]</a></p>

<p>But still the old spirit and life of the drama of the<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_341">[p. 341]</span> seventeenth century
were not there. The audiences, who were as unlike those of the
cavalier times of Philip the Fourth as were the rude exhibitions
they preferred to witness, did as much to degrade the theatre as was
done by the poets they patronized and the actors they applauded. The
two schools were in presence of each other continually struggling
for the victory, and the multitude seemed rather to rejoice in the
uproar, than desire so to use it as to promote changes beneficial to
the theatre. On the one side, extravagant and absurd dramas in great
numbers, full of noise, show, and low buffoonery, were offered with
success. On the other, meagre sentimental comedies, and stiff, cold
translations from the French, were forced, in almost equal numbers,
upon the actors by the voices of those from whose authority or support
they could not entirely emancipate themselves. And between the two,
and with the consent of all, the Inquisition and the censors forbade
the representation of hundreds of the dramas of the old masters, and
among them not a few which still give reputation to Calderon and Lope.
The eighteenth century, therefore, so far as the Spanish theatre is
concerned, is entirely a period of revolution and change; and while,
at its conclusion, we perceive that the old national drama can hardly
hope to be restored to its ancient rights, it is equally plain that
a drama founded on the doctrines taught by Luzan, and practised by
the Moratins, is not destined to take its place.<a id="FNanchor_389"

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> reign of Charles the Fourth was
not one in which a literary contest could be carried on with the
freedom that alone can render such contests the means of intellectual
progress. His profligate favorite, the Prince of the Peace, during a
long administration of the affairs of the country, overshadowed every
thing with an influence hardly less fatal to what he patronized than
to what he oppressed. The revolution in France, first resisted, as it
was elsewhere, and then corruptly conciliated, struck the same terror
at Madrid that it did at Rome and Naples; and, while its open defiance
of every thing Christian filled the hearts of a large majority of the
Spanish people with a horror greater than it inspired even in Italy,
not a few were led away by it from their time-honored feelings of
religion and loyalty, and prepared for changes like those that were
already overturning the thrones of half Europe. Amidst this confusion,
and taking advantage of it, the Inquisition, grown flexible in the
hands of the government as a political machine, but still renouncing
none of its religious pretensions, came forth with its last “Index
Expurgatorius” to meet the invasion of French<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_344">[p. 344]</span> philosophy and insubordination.<a
id="FNanchor_390" href="#Footnote_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a>
Acting under express instructions from the powers of the state it
received against men of letters, and especially those connected with
the universities, an immense number of denunciations, which, though
rarely prosecuted to conviction and punishment, were still formidable
enough to prevent the public expression of opinions on any subject that
could endanger the social condition of the individual who ventured to
entertain them. In all its worst forms, therefore, oppression, civil,
political, and religious, appeared to be settling down with a new and
portentous weight on the whole country. All men felt it. It seemed
as if the very principle of life in the atmosphere they breathed had
become tainted and unwholesome. But they felt, too, that the same
atmosphere was charged with the spirit of a great revolution; and the
boldest walked warily and were hushed, while they waited for changes
the shock of whose fierce elements none could willingly encounter.</p>

<p>At last the convulsion came. In 1807, the heir apparent was brought
into direct collision with the Prince of the Peace, and took measures
to defend his personal rights. The affair of the Escurial followed;
darker than the dark cells in which it was conceived. Ferdinand was
accused, under the influence of the favorite, with a design to dethrone
and murder his own father and mother; and, for a moment, Europe seemed
threat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">[p. 345]</span>ened with a
crime which even the unscrupulous despotism of Philip the Second had
not ventured to commit. This was prevented by the manly boldness and
constancy of Escoiquiz. But things could not long remain in the uneasy
and treacherous position in which such a rash attempt at convulsion
had left them. The great revolution broke out at Aranjuez in March,
1808; Charles the Fourth abdicated in shame and terror; and Ferdinand
the Seventh ascended the tottering throne of his ancestors amidst the
exultation of his people. But Napoleon, then at the summit of his vast
power, interfered in the troubles he had not been unwilling to foster.
Under the pretext, that such fatal differences as had arisen between
the father and son would disturb the affairs of Europe, he drew the
royal family of Spain into his toils at Bayonne; and there, on the soil
of France, the crown of the Bourbon race in Spain was ignominiously
surrendered into his hands, and by him placed on the head of his
brother, already king of Naples.</p>

<p>It was all the work of a few short weeks; and the fate of Spain
seemed to be sealed with a seal that no human power would be permitted
to break. But the people of that land of faith and chivalry were not
forgetful of their ancient honor in this the day of their great trial.
They boldly refused to ratify the treaty to which father and son had
alike put their dishonored names, and sprang to arms to prevent its
provisions from being fulfilled by foreign intervention. It was a
fierce struggle. For nearly six years, the forces of France were spread
over the country, sometimes seeming to cover the whole of it, and
sometimes only small portions, but seldom exerting any real control
beyond the camps they occupied and the cities they from time<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_346">[p. 346]</span> to time garrisoned.
At last, in 1813, under the leading of England, the invaders were
driven through the gorges of the Pyrenees; and, as a part of the great
European retribution, Ferdinand the Seventh was replaced on the throne
he had so weakly abdicated.</p>

<p>He was received by his people with a loyalty that seemed to belong
to the earliest ages of the monarchy. But it was lost on him. He
returned untaught by the misfortunes he had suffered, and unmoved by a
fidelity which had showed itself ready to sacrifice a whole generation
and its hopes to his honor and rights. As far as was possible, he
restored all the forms and appliances of the old despotism, and thrust
from his confidence the very men who had brought him home on their
shields, and who only claimed for their country the exercise of a
salutary freedom, without which he himself could not be maintained
on the throne where their courage and constancy had seated him.<a
id="FNanchor_391" href="#Footnote_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a>
Even the Inquisition, which it had been one of the most popular acts
of the French invaders to abolish, and one of the wisest acts of the
national Cortes to declare incompatible with the constitution of the
monarchy, was solemnly reinstated; and if, during a reign protracted
through twenty sad and troubled years, any proper freedom was for a
moment granted to thought, to speech, or to the press, it was only in
consequence of changes over<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">[p.
347]</span> which the prince had no control, and of which he felt
himself to be rather the victim than the author.<a id="FNanchor_392"
href="#Footnote_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a></p>

<p>Amidst such violence and confusion,—when men slept in armour, as
they had during the Moorish contest, and knew not whether they should
be waked amidst their households or amidst their enemies,—elegant
letters, of course, could hardly hope to find shelter or resting-place.
The grave political questions, that agitated the country and shook
the foundations of society, were precisely those in which it might
be foreseen, that intellectual men would take the deepest interest
and expose themselves to sufferings and ruin, like the less favored
masses around them. And so, in fact, it proved. Nearly every poet
and prose-writer, known as such at the end of the reign of Charles
the Fourth, became involved in the fierce political changes of the
time;—changes so various and so opposite, that those who escaped from
the consequences of one were often, on that very account, sure to
suffer in the next that followed.</p>

<p>The young men who, during this disastrous period, were just
beginning to unfold their promise, were checked at the outset of their
career. Martinez de la Rosa, five years a prisoner of state on a rock
in Africa before he had reached the age of thirty; Angel de Rivas,
still younger, left for dead on the bloody field of Ocaña; Galiano,
sentenced to the scaffold while he was earning his daily bread by
daily labor as a teacher in London; Torreno, brought home on his bier,
as he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">[p. 348]</span> returned
from his third exile; Arriaza serving in the armies of Ferdinand;
Arjona and Barbero silenced; Xavier de Burgos plundered; Gallego,
Xerica, Hermosilla, Mauri, Mora, Tapia;—these, and many others, all
young men and full of the hopes that letters inspire in generous
spirits, were seized upon by the passions of party or the demands of
patriotism, and hurried into paths far from the pursuits to which their
talents, their taste, and their social relations would alike have
dedicated them;—pursuits on which, in fact, they had already entered,
and to which they have since owed their most brilliant and enduring
distinctions, as well as their truest happiness.</p>

<p>Those who were older, and had been before marked by success and
public favor, fared still worse. The eyes of men had already been
fastened upon them, and in the conflict and crush of the contending
factions they were sure to suffer, as one or another prevailed in the
long-protracted struggle. Jovellanos and Cienfuegos, as we have seen,
were almost instantly martyrs to their patriotism. Melendez Valdes sunk
a later and more miserable victim. Conde and Escoiquiz were exiled for
opposite reasons. Moratin, after having faced death in the frightful
form of want in his own country, survived to a fate in France hardly
less to be dreaded. Quintana was cast by his ungrateful sovereign into
the Bastile of Pamplona, with an apparent intention that he should
perish there. To all of them the happiness of success in letters,
to which they had been accustomed amidst the encouragement of their
friends and countrymen, was denied;—from all, the hopes of fame seemed
to be cut off. Most of them, and most of the small class to which
they belonged, passed, as voluntary or involuntary exiles, beyond the
limits of a country which they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">[p.
349]</span> might still be compelled to love, but which they could no
longer respect. The rest were silent. It was an interregnum in all
elegant culture, such as no modern nation had yet seen,—not even Spain
herself during the War of the Succession.</p>

<p>But it was not possible that such a state of things should become
permanent and normal. Even while Ferdinand the Seventh was living, a
movement was begun, the first traces of which are to be found among
the emigrated Spaniards, who cheered with letters their exile in
England and France, and whose subsequent progress, from the time when
the death of that unfaithful monarch permitted them to return home,
is distinctly perceptible in their own country.<a id="FNanchor_393"
href="#Footnote_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a> What precise direction
this movement may hereafter take, or where it may end, it is not given
us to foresee. Perhaps too much of foreign influence, and too great a
tendency to infuse the spirit of the North into a poetry whose nature
is peculiarly Southern, may, for a time, divert it from its true
course. Or perhaps the national genius, springing forward through all
that opposes its instincts, and shaking off whatever encumbers it with
ill-considered help, may press directly onward, and complete the canon
of a literature whose forms, often only sketched by the great masters
of its age of glory, remain yet to be filled out and finished in the
grandeur and grace of their proper proportions.</p>

<p>But, whether a great advancement may soon be hoped for or not, one
thing is certain. The law of progress is on Spain for good or for
evil, as it is on the other na<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">[p.
350]</span>tions of the earth, and her destiny, like theirs, is in the
hand of God, and will be fulfilled. The material resources of her soil
and position are as great as those of any people that now occupies its
meted portion of the globe. The mass of her inhabitants, and especially
of her peasantry, has been less changed, and in many respects less
corrupted, by the revolutions of the last century, than any of the
nations who have pressed her borders, or contended with her power. They
are the same race of men, who twice drove back the crescent from the
shores of Europe, and twice saved from shipwreck the great cause of
Christian civilization. They have shown the same spirit at Saragossa,
that they showed two thousand years before at Saguntum. They are not
a ruined people. And, while they preserve the sense of honor, the
sincerity, and the contempt for what is sordid and base, that have so
long distinguished their national character, they cannot be ruined.</p>

<p>Nor, I trust, will such a people—still proud and faithful in its
less favored masses, if not in those portions whose names dimly shadow
forth the glory they have inherited—fail to create a literature
appropriate to a character in its nature so poetical. The old ballads
will not indeed return; for the feelings that produced them are with
by-gone things. The old drama will not be revived;—society, even
in Spain, would not now endure its excesses. The old chroniclers
themselves, if they should come back, would find no miracles of valor
or superstition to record, and no credulity fond enough to believe
them. Their poets will not again be monks and soldiers, as they were in
the days when the influences of the old religious wars and hatreds gave
both their brightest and darkest colors to the elements of social life;
for the civilization that struck its roots into<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_351">[p. 351]</span> that soil has died out for want of
nourishment. But the Spanish people—that old Castilian race, that came
from the mountains and filled the whole land with their spirit—have, I
trust, a future before them not unworthy of their ancient fortunes and
fame; a future full of materials for a generous history, and a poetry
still more generous;—happy if they have been taught, by the experience
of the past, that, while reverence for whatever is noble and worthy
is of the essence of poetical inspiration, and, while religious faith
and feeling constitute its true and sure foundations, there is yet a
loyalty to mere rank and place, which degrades alike its possessor
and him it would honor, and a blind submission to priestly authority,
which narrows and debases the nobler faculties of the soul more than
any other, because it sends its poison deeper. But, if they have failed
to learn this solemn lesson, inscribed everywhere, as by the hand of
Heaven, on the crumbling walls of their ancient institutions, then is
their honorable history, both in civilization and letters, closed for
ever.</p>

  <p class="subh3 centra">(See Vol. I. pp. 11 and 47.)</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> country which now passes
under the name of Spain has been subjected to a greater number of
revolutions, that have left permanent traces in its population,
language, and literature, than any other of the principal countries
of modern Europe.<a id="FNanchor_394" href="#Footnote_394"
class="fnanchor">[394]</a> At different periods, within the reach of
authentic record, it has been invaded and occupied by the Phœnicians,
the Romans, the Goths, and the Arabs; all distinct races of men with
peculiar characteristics, and forming, in their various combinations
with each other or with the earlier masters of the soil, still new
races hardly less separate and remarkable than themselves. From the
intimate union of them all, gradually wrought by the changes and
convulsions of nearly three thousand years, has arisen the present
Spanish people, whose literature, extending back about seven centuries,
has been examined in the preceding volumes.</p>

<p>But it is difficult fully to examine or understand the literature of
any country, without understanding something, at least, of the original
elements and history of the language in which<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_356">[p. 356]</span> it is contained, and on which no small
portion of its essential character must depend; while, at the same
time, a knowledge of the origin of the language necessarily implies
some knowledge of the nations that, by successive contributions, have
constituted it such as it is found in the final forms of its poetry
and elegant prose. As a needful appendix, therefore, to the history
of Spanish literature, a very brief account will be here given of the
different occupants of the soil of the country, who, in a greater or
less degree, have contributed to form the present character both of the
Spanish people and of their language and culture.</p>

<p>The oldest of these, and the people who, since we can go back no
farther, must be by us regarded as the original inhabitants of the
Spanish Peninsula, were the Iberians. They appear, at the remotest
period of which tradition affords us any notice, to have been spread
over the whole territory, and to have given to its mountains, rivers,
and cities most of the names they still bear,—a fierce race, whose
power has never been entirely broken by any of the long line of
invaders who, at different times, have occupied the rest of the
country. Even at this moment, a body of their descendants, less
affected than we should have supposed possible by intercourse with
the various nations that have successively pressed their borders, is
believed, with a good degree of probability, to be recognized under the
name of Biscayans, inhabiting the mountains in the northwestern portion
of modern Spain. But, whether this be true or not, the Biscayans, down
to the present day, have been a singular and a separate race. They have
a peculiar language, peculiar local institutions, and a literature
which is carried back to a remoter antiquity than that of any other
people now possessing, not the soil of the Spanish Peninsula merely,
but of any part of Southern Europe. They are, in fact, a people who
seem to have been left as a solitary race, hardly connected, even by
those ties of language which outlive all others, with any race of
men now in existence or on record; some of their present customs and
popular fables claiming to have come down from an age, of which history
and tradition give only doubtful intimations. The<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_357">[p. 357]</span> most probable conjecture yet proposed to
explain what there is peculiar and remarkable about the Biscayans and
their language is that which supposes them to be descended from those
ancient and mysterious Iberians, whose language seems to have been, at
one period, spread through the whole Peninsula, and to have left traces
which are recognized even in the present Spanish.<a id="FNanchor_395"
href="#Footnote_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a></p>

<p>The first intruders upon the Iberians were the Celts, who, according
to Doctor Percy’s theory, constituted the foremost wave of the
successive emigrations that broke upon Europe from the overflowing
multitudes of Asia. At what precise period the Celts reached Spain,
or any other of the Western countries they overran, can no longer
be determined. But the contest between the invaders of the soil and
its possessors<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">[p. 358]</span>
was, from the few intimations of it that have come down to us, long
and bloody; and, as was generally the case in the early successful
invasions of countries by wandering masses of the human race,
portions of the ancient inhabitants were driven to the fastnesses
of their mountains, and the remainder became gradually incorporated
with the conquerors. The new people, thus formed of two races that,
in antiquity, had the reputation of being warlike and powerful,
was appropriately called the Celtiberian,<a id="FNanchor_396"
href="#Footnote_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a> and constituted the
body of the population which, broken into various tribes, but with
similar manners and institutions, occupied the Peninsula when it first
became known to the civilized nations of Europe. The language of the
Celts, as might be expected, is represented in the present Spanish,
as it is in the French and even in the Italian, though but slightly,
of course, in any of them.<a id="FNanchor_397" href="#Footnote_397"
class="fnanchor">[397]</a></p>

<p>Thus far, all access to Spain had been by land; for, in the earliest
periods of the world’s history, no other mode of emigration or
invasion was known. But the Phœnicians, the oldest commercial people
of classical antiquity, soon afterwards found their way thither over
the waters of the Mediterranean. At what time they arrived in Spain,
or where they made their first establishment, is not known. A mystery
hangs over this remarkable people, darker than belongs to the<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_359">[p. 359]</span> age in which they lived,
and connected, no doubt, with the wary spirit in which they pursued
their commercial adventures. Their position at home made colonization
the obvious and almost the only means of commercial wealth among
them, and Spain proved the most tempting of the countries to which
their power could reach. Their chief Spanish colonies were near the
Pillars of Hercules, in the neighbourhood of our present Cadiz, which
they probably founded, and about the mouth and on the banks of the
Guadalquivir. Their great object was the mines of precious metals with
which ancient Spain abounded. For Spain, from the earliest notices of
its history till the fall of the Roman Empire, was the El Dorado of the
rest of the world, and furnished a large proportion of the materials
for its circulating wealth.<a id="FNanchor_398" href="#Footnote_398"
class="fnanchor">[398]</a> During a long period, too, these mines
seem to have been known only to the Phœnicians, who thus reserved to
themselves the secret of a great power and influence over the nations
near them, while, at the same time,—establishing colonies, as was their
custom, to secure the sources of their wealth,—they carried their
language and manners through a considerable part of the South of Spain,
and even far round on the shores of the Atlantic.<a id="FNanchor_399"
href="#Footnote_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a></p>

<p>But the Phœnicians had still earlier founded a colony on the
northern coast of Africa, which, under the name of Carthage, was
destined to grow more powerful than the country that sent it forth.
Its means were the same; for the Carthaginians became eminently
a commercial people, and depended, in no small degree, upon the
resources of their colonies.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">[p.
360]</span> They trod closely and almost constantly in the footsteps
of their mother country, and often supplanted her power. It was, in
fact, through the Phœnician colonies that the Carthaginians entered
Spain, whose tempting territory was divided from them only by the
Mediterranean. But for a long period, though they maintained a large
military force in Cadiz, and stretched their possessions boldly and
successfully along the Spanish shores, they did not seem inclined to
penetrate far into the interior, or to do more than occupy enough of
the country to overawe its population and control its trade. When,
however, the First Punic War had rendered Spain of more consequence
to the Carthaginians than it had ever been before, they undertook its
entire conquest and occupation. Under Hamilcar, the father of Hannibal,
about two hundred and twenty-seven years before the Christian era, they
spread themselves at once over nearly the whole country, as far as the
Iberus, and, building Carthagena and some other strong places, seemed
to have taken final possession of the Peninsula, on which the Romans
had not yet set foot.</p>

<p>The Romans, however, were not slow to perceive the advantage
their dangerous rivals had gained. By the first treaty of peace made
between these great powers, it was stipulated, that the Carthaginians
should advance no farther,—should neither molest Saguntum nor cross
the Iberus. Hannibal violated these conditions, and the Second Punic
War broke out, two hundred and eighteen years before the Christian
era. The Scipios entered Spain in consequence of it; and at its
conclusion, in the year B. C. 201, the Carthaginians had no longer any
possessions in Europe, though, as descendants of the Phœnicians, they
left in the population and language of Spain traces which have never
been wholly obliterated.<a id="FNanchor_400" href="#Footnote_400"
class="fnanchor">[400]</a></p>

<p>But,<a id="FNanchor_401" href="#Footnote_401"
class="fnanchor">[401]</a> though, by the Second Punic War, the
Carthaginians<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">[p. 361]</span> were
thus driven from the Spanish Peninsula, the Romans were far from having
obtained unmolested or secure possession of it. The Carthaginians
themselves, even when engaged in a commerce whose spirit was, on the
whole, peaceful, had never ceased to be in contest with the warlike
Celtiberian tribes of the interior; and the Romans were obliged to
accept the inheritance of a warfare to which, in their character
of intruders, they naturally succeeded. The Roman Senate, indeed,
according to their usual policy, chose to regard Spain, from the end
of the Second Punic War, both as conquered and as a province; and,
in truth, they had really obtained permanent and quiet possession of
a considerable part of it. But, from the time when the Roman armies
first entered the Peninsula until they became masters of the whole of
it,—except the mountains of the Northwest, which never yielded to their
power,—two complete centuries elapsed, filled with bloodshed and crime.
No province cost the Roman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">[p.
362]</span> people a price so great. The struggle for Numantia, which
lasted fourteen years, the wars against Viriates, and the war of
Sertorius,—to say nothing of that between Pompey and Cæsar,—all show
the formidable character of the protracted contest by which alone
the Roman power could be confirmed in the Peninsula; so that, though
Spain was the first portion of the continent out of Italy which the
Romans began to occupy as a province, it was the very last of which
their possession was peaceful and unquestioned.<a id="FNanchor_402"
href="#Footnote_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a></p>

<p>From the outset, however, there was a tendency to a union between
the two races, wherever the conquerors were able to establish quietness
and order; for the vast advantages of Roman civilization could be
obtained only by the adoption of Roman manners and the Latin language.
This union, from the great importance of the province, the Romans
desired no less than the natives. Forty-seven years only after they
entered Spain, a colony, consisting of a large body of the descendants
from the mingled blood of Romans and natives, was established by
a formal decree of the Senate, with privileges beyond the usual
policy of their government.<a id="FNanchor_403" href="#Footnote_403"
class="fnanchor">[403]</a> A little later, colonies of all kinds
were greatly multiplied; and it is impossible to read Cæsar and Livy
without feeling that the Roman policy was more generous to Spain, than
it was to any other of the countries that successively came within
its control. Tarragona, where the Scipios first landed, Carthagena,
founded by Asdrubal, and Córdova, always so important, early took
the forms and character of the larger municipalities in Italy; and,
in the time of Strabo, Cadiz, for numbers, wealth, and activity, was
second only to Rome itself.<a id="FNanchor_404" href="#Footnote_404"
class="fnanchor">[404]</a> Long, there<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_363">[p. 363]</span>fore, before Agrippa had broken the power
of the mountaineers at the North, the whole South, with its rich and
luxuriant valleys, had become like another Italy; a fact, of which the
descriptions in the third book of Pliny’s Natural History can leave
no reasonable doubt. To this, however, we should add the remarkable
circumstance, that the Emperor Vespasian, soon after the pacification
of the North, found it for his interest to extend to the whole of Spain
the privileges of the municipalities in Latium.<a id="FNanchor_405"
href="#Footnote_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a></p>

<p>Spaniards, too, earlier than any other strangers, obtained those
distinctions of which the Romans themselves were so ambitious, and
which they so reluctantly granted to any but native citizens. The
first foreigner that ever rose to the consulship was Balbus, from
Cadiz, and he, too, was the first foreigner that ever gained the
honors of a public triumph. The first foreigner that ever sat on the
throne of the world was Trajan, a native of Italica, near Seville;<a
id="FNanchor_406" href="#Footnote_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a> and
indeed, if we examine the history of Rome from the time of Hannibal
to the fall of the Western Empire, we shall probably find that no
part of the world, beyond the limits of Italy, contributed so much to
the resources, wealth, and power of the capital, as Spain, and that
no province received, in return, so large a share of the honors and
dignities of the Roman government.</p>

<p>On all accounts, therefore, the connection between Rome and Spain
was intimate, and the civilization and refinement of the province took
their character early from those of the capital. Sertorius found it a
wise policy to cause the children of the principal native families to
be taught Latin and Greek, and to become accomplished in the literature
and elegant knowledge to be found in those admirable languages;<a
id="FNanchor_407" href="#Footnote_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a> and
when, ten years later, Metellus, in his turn, had crushed the power
of Sertorius, and came home triumphant to Rome, he brought with him
a number of native Cordovan poets, against<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_364">[p. 364]</span> whose Latinity the fastidious ear of
Cicero was able to object only that their accent had <i>pingue quiddam
... atque peregrinum</i>,—something thick, or rude, and foreign.<a
id="FNanchor_408" href="#Footnote_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a></p>

<p>From this period Latin writers began to be constantly
produced in Spain.<a id="FNanchor_409" href="#Footnote_409"
class="fnanchor">[409]</a> Portius Latro, a native of Córdova, but
a public advocate of the highest reputation at Rome, opened in
the metropolis the earliest of those schools for Roman rhetoric,
that afterwards became so numerous and so famous, and, among other
distinguished men, numbered as his disciples Octavius Cæsar, Mæcenas,
Marcus Agrippa, and Ovid. The two Senecas were Spaniards, and so was
Lucan; names celebrated enough, certainly, to have conferred lasting
glory on any city within the limits of the Empire. Martial came from
Bilbilis, and, in his old age, retired there again to die in peace,
amidst the scenes which, during his whole life, seem to have been dear
to him. Columella, too, the best of the Roman writers on agriculture,
was a Spaniard; and so, it is probable, were Quinctilian and Silius
Italicus. Many others might be added, whose rights and reputation were
fully acknowledged in the capital of the world, during the last days
of the Republic, or the best days of the Empire, as orators, poets,
and historians; but their works, though famous in their own time, have
perished in the general wreck of the larger part of ancient literature.
The great lights, however, of Roman letters in Spain are familiar to
all, and are at once recognized as constituting an important portion
of the body of the Latin classics, and an essential part of the glory
of Roman civilization.<a id="FNanchor_410" href="#Footnote_410"
class="fnanchor">[410]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">[p. 365]</span>After this
period, no considerable change, that needs to be noticed, took place in
the Spanish Peninsula, until the final overthrow of the Roman power.<a
id="FNanchor_411" href="#Footnote_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a>
Undoubtedly, at the Northwest, and especially among the mountains and
valleys of what is now called Biscay, the language and institutions of
Rome were never established;<a id="FNanchor_412" href="#Footnote_412"
class="fnanchor">[412]</a> but, in all the remainder of the country,
whatever there was of public policy or intellectual refinement rested
on the basis of the Roman character and of Roman civilization. But the
Roman character and civilization decayed there, as they did everywhere,
and though, during the last four centuries in which the Imperial
authority was acknowledged in Spain, the country enjoyed more of
tranquillity than was enjoyed in any other province within the limits
of the Empire, still, like the others, it was much disturbed during the
whole of this fatal period, and was gradually yielding to the common
destiny.</p>

<p>It was during this troubled interval, that another great cause of
change was introduced into Spain, and began to produce its wide effects
on whatever of intellectual culture existed in the country. This great
cause was Christianity. The precise point of time, or the precise
mode, of its first appearance in Spain cannot now be determined. But
it was certainly taught there in the second century, and seems to have
come in, through the southern coast, from Africa.<a id="FNanchor_413"
href="#Footnote_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a> At first, as elsewhere,
it was persecuted, and therefore professed<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_366">[p. 366]</span> in secret; but, as early as the year
300, churches had been publicly established, and from the time of
Constantine and Osius of Córdova, it was the acknowledged and prevalent
religion of large parts of the country. What is of consequence to us
is, that the language of Christianity in Spain was the Latin. Its
instructions were obviously given in Latin, and its early literature,
so far as it appeared in Spain, is found wholly in that language.<a
id="FNanchor_414" href="#Footnote_414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a> This
is very important, not only because it proves the great diffusion of
the Latin language there from the third century to the eighth, but
because it shows that no other language was left strong enough to
contend with it, at least through the middle and southern portions of
the country.</p>

<p>The Christian clergy, however, it must be recollected, did
little or nothing to preserve the purity of the Latin language in
Spain, or to maintain whatever of an intellectual tone they found
in the institutions established by the Romans.<a id="FNanchor_415"
href="#Footnote_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a> How<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_367">[p. 367]</span> early these institutions,
and especially the ancient schools, decayed there, we do not know; but
it was earlier than in some other parts of the Empire. In the fifth,
sixth, and seventh centuries even the ecclesiastics were sunk into
the grossest ignorance, so that, when Gregory the Great, who was Pope
from 590 to 604, warned Licinian, Bishop of Carthagena, not to give
consecration to persons without education, Licinian replied, that,
unless it were permitted to consecrate those who knew only that Christ
had been crucified, none could be found to fill the priestly office.<a
id="FNanchor_416" href="#Footnote_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a>
In fact, Isidore of Seville, the famous Archbishop and saint, who
died in 636, is the last of the Spanish ecclesiastics that attempted
to write Latin with purity; and even he thought so ill of classical
antiquity, that he prohibited the monks under his control from reading
books written by heathen of the olden time;<a id="FNanchor_417"
href="#Footnote_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a> thus taking away the
only means of preserving from its threatened corruption the language
they wrote and spoke.<a id="FNanchor_418" href="#Footnote_418"
class="fnanchor">[418]</a> Of course this corruption advanced, in times
of confusion and national trouble, at a rapid pace, until the spoken
language of the country be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">[p.
368]</span>came, to those out of it, an almost unintelligible jargon;
and the offices of the Church, as they were read at mass and on feast
days, could no longer be understood by the body of the worshippers.
This was the result, partly of the decay of all the Roman institutions,
and, indeed, of all the principles on which those institutions had
rested, and partly of the invasion and conquest of the country by
the Northern barbarians, whose irruption, with the violences that
followed it, left for a long time neither the quietness nor the sense
of security necessary even to the humblest intellectual culture.<a
id="FNanchor_419" href="#Footnote_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a></p>

<p>This great irruption of the Northern barbarians effected another
and most important revolution in the language of the Peninsula. It
in fact gave to it a new character. For the race of men by whom it
was made was entirely different, both in its origin, its language,
and, indeed, in all that goes to make up national character, from the
four races that had previously occupied the country. The new invaders
belonged to those vast multitudes beyond the Rhine, who had been much
known to the Romans from the time of Julius Cæsar, and who, at the
period of which we speak, had been, for above a century, leaning with
a portentous weight upon the failing barriers, which, on the banks of
that glorious stream, had long marked the limits of Roman power. Urged
forward, not only by the natural disposition of Northern nations to
come into a milder climate, and of barbarous nations to obtain the
spoils of civilization, but by uneasy movements among the Tartars of
Upper Asia, which were communicated through the Sclavonic tribes to
those of Germany, their accumulated masses burst, in the beginning
of the fifth century, with an irresistible impulse, on the wide and
ill-defended borders of the Empire. Without noticing the tumultuous
attempts that preceded this final and fatal invasion and were either
defeated or turned aside, it is enough to say, that the first hordes
of the irruption which succeeded in overthrowing the empire of the
world began to pass the Rhine at the end of the year 406, and in
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">[p. 369]</span> beginning of
407. These hordes, however, were pressed forward, it may be said almost
without a figure, by the merely physical weight of the large bodies
that followed them. Tribe succeeded tribe, with all the facility and
haste of a nomadic life, which knows neither local attachments nor
local interests, and with all the eagerness and violence of barbarians
seeking the grosser luxuries of civilization; so that when, at the
end of that century, the last of the greater warlike emigrations had
forced for itself a place within the limits of the Roman empire, it
may be truly said, that, from the Rhine and the British Channel on the
one side, to Calabria and Gibraltar on the other, there was hardly a
spot of that empire over which they had not passed, and few where they
were not then to be found possessors of the soil, and masters of the
political and military power.<a id="FNanchor_420" href="#Footnote_420"
class="fnanchor">[420]</a></p>

<p>In the particular character of the multitudes that finally
established themselves within its territory, Spain was certainly
less unfortunate than were most of the countries of Europe, that
were in a similar manner invaded. The first tribes that rushed over
the Pyrenees—the Franks, who came before the general invasion,
and the Vandali, the Alani, and the Suevi, who, as far as Spain
was concerned, formed its vanguard—committed, no doubt, atrocious
excesses, and produced a state of cruel suffering, which is eloquently
and indignantly described in a well-known passage of Mariana;<a
id="FNanchor_421" href="#Footnote_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a> but,
after a comparatively short period, these tribes or nations passed
over into Africa and never returned. The Goths, who succeeded them
as invaders, were, it is true, barbarians, like their predecessors,
but they were barbarians of a milder and more generous type. They
had already been in Italy, where they had become somewhat acquainted
with the Roman laws, manners, and language; and when, in 411, they
traversed the South of France and entered the Peninsula, they were
received rather as friends than as conquerors.<a id="FNanchor_422"
href="#Footnote_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a> Indeed, at first, their
authority was exercised in the name and on behalf of the Empire; but,
before the century was ended, the last Emperor of the West had<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_370">[p. 370]</span> ceased to reign; and, by
a sort of inevitable necessity, the Visigoth dynasty was established
throughout nearly the whole of Spain, and acknowledged by Odoacer, the
earliest of the barbarian kings of Italy.</p>

<p>Previously, however, to the entrance of the Visigoths into Spain,
they had been converted to Christianity by the venerable Ulfilas;
and, as early as 466-484, in a period of great confusion, they had
formed for themselves a criminal code of laws, to which, in 506, they
added a civil code,—the two being subsequently made to constitute the
basis of that important body of laws which, above a century later,
was compiled by the fourth Council of Toledo.<a id="FNanchor_423"
href="#Footnote_423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a> But, though the
Visigoths had thus adopted some of the most important means of
civilization, their language, like that of the rest of the Northern
invaders, remained essentially barbarous. It was never, at any time,
in Spain, a written language. It was of the Teutonic stock, and had
nothing, or almost nothing, in common with the Latin. Still, the
people who spoke it were so intimately mingled with the conquered
people, and each, from its position, had become so dependent on the
other, that it was no longer a question whether they should find some
medium of communication suited to the daily and hourly intercourse
of common life. They were, in fact, compelled to do so. The same
consequences, therefore, followed, that followed in the other Roman
or Romanized countries which were invaded in the same way. A union
of the two languages took place; but not a union on equal terms.
This was impossible. For on the side of the Latin were not only the
existing, though decayed, institutions of the country, but whatever
of civilization and refinement was still to be found in the world, as
well as the vast and growing power of the Christian religion, with
its organized priesthood, which refused to be heard in any other
language. So that, if the Goths, on their part, had the political and
military authority, and even a more fresh and vigorous intellectual
character, they were obliged, on the whole, to submit to such
prevalent influences, and to adopt, in a great<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_371">[p. 371]</span> degree, the language through which alone
they could obtain the benefits of a more advanced state of society.
The Latin, therefore, corrupted and degraded as it was, remained in
Spain, as it did in the other countries where similar races of men came
together, by far the most prominent element in the language that grew
out of their union, and was thus made to constitute the grand basis of
the modern Spanish.</p>

<p>The most considerable change effected by the invaders in the
language they found established in Spain was a change in its
grammatical structure. The Goths, like any uncivilized people, could
learn the individual words of the more cultivated language they every
day heard, easier than they could comprehend the philosophical spirit
of its grammar. While, therefore, they freely adopted the large and
convenient vocabulary of the Latin, they compelled its complicated
forms and constructions to yield to the simpler constructions and
habits of their own native dialects. This may be illustrated by
the striking changes they wrought in the established inflections
of the Latin nouns and verbs. The Romans, it is well known, had
strict declensions to mark the relations of their nouns, and strict
conjugations by which they distinguished the times of their verbs.
The Goths had neither, but used articles united with prepositions to
mark the cases of their nouns, and auxiliaries of different kinds to
mark the changes in the meanings of their verbs.<a id="FNanchor_424"
href="#Footnote_424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a></p>

<p>When, therefore, in Spain, they received the Latin, where no
article existed, they compelled <i>ille</i>, as the nearest word they
could find, to serve for their definite article, and <i>unus</i> for their
indefinite,—so that, in their oldest deeds and other documents, we
find such phrases as <i>ille</i> homo, <i>the</i> man; <i>unus</i> homo, <i>a</i> man;
<i>illa</i> mulier, <i>the</i> woman; and so on,—from<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_372">[p. 372]</span> which the modern Spanish derives its
articles <i>el</i> and <i>la</i>, <i>uno</i>, <i>una</i>, etc., just as the French, by a
similar process, obtained the articles <i>le</i> and <i>la</i>, <i>un</i> and <i>une</i>,
and the Italians <i>il</i> and <i>la</i>, <i>uno</i> and <i>una</i>.<a id="FNanchor_425"
href="#Footnote_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a> The same sort of
compromise took place in relation to the verbs. Instead of <i>vici</i>, I
have conquered, they said <i>habeo victus</i>; instead of saying <i>amor</i>, I
am loved, they said <i>sum amatus</i>; and from such a use of <i>habere</i> and
<i>esse</i>, they introduced into the modern Spanish the auxiliaries <i>haber</i>
and <i>ser</i>, as the Italians introduced <i>avere</i> and <i>essere</i>, and the
French <i>avoir</i> and <i>être</i>.<a id="FNanchor_426" href="#Footnote_426"
class="fnanchor">[426]</a> This example of the effect produced by
the Goths on the nouns and verbs of the Latin is but a specimen of
the changes they brought about in the general structure of that
language, by which they contributed their full share towards still
further corrupting it, as well as towards modelling it into the
present Spanish;—a great revolution, which it required above seven
centuries fairly to accomplish, and two or three centuries more
entirely to carry out into all its final results.<a id="FNanchor_427"
href="#Footnote_427" class="fnanchor">[427]</a></p>

<p>But, in the mean time, another tremendous invasion had burst upon
Spain; violent, unforeseen, and for a time threatening to sweep away
all the civilization and refinement, that had been preserved from the
old institutions of the country, or were springing up under the new.
This was the remarkable invasion of the Arabs, which compels us now
to seek some of the materials of the Spanish character, language,
and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">[p. 373]</span> literature in
the heart of Asia, as we have already been obliged to seek for some of
them in the extreme North of Europe.</p>

<p>The Arabs, who, at every period of their history, have been a
picturesque and extraordinary people, received, from the passionate
religion given to them by the genius and fanaticism of Mohammed, an
impulse that, in most respects, is unparalleled. As late as the year
of Christ 623, the fortunes and the fate of the Prophet were still
uncertain, even within the narrow limits of his own wild and wandering
tribe; yet, in less than a century from that time, not only Persia,
Syria, and nearly the whole of Western Asia, but Egypt and all the
North of Africa had yielded to the power of his military faith. A
success so wide and so rapid, founded on religious enthusiasm, and
so speedily followed by the refinements of civilization, is unlike
any thing else in the history of the world.<a id="FNanchor_428"
href="#Footnote_428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a></p>

<p>When the Arabs had obtained a tolerably quiet possession of the
cities and coasts of Africa, it was natural they should turn next
to Spain, from which they were separated only by the straits of the
Mediterranean. Their descent was made, in great force, near Gibraltar,
in 711; the battle of the Guadalete, as it is called by the Moorish
writers, and of Xerez, as it is called by the Christians, followed
immediately; and, in the course of three years, they had, with their
accustomed celerity, conquered the whole of Spain, except the fated
region of the Northwest, behind whose mountains a large body of
Christians, under Pelayo, retreated, leaving the rest of their country
in the hands of the conquerors.</p>

<p>But while the Christians, who had escaped from the wreck of
the Gothic power, were thus either shut up in the mountains of
Biscay and Asturias, or engaged in that desperate struggle of
nearly eight centuries, which ended in the final expulsion of
their invaders, the Moors<a id="FNanchor_429" href="#Footnote_429"
class="fnanchor">[429]</a> throughout the centre and especially
throughout the South of Spain were enjoying<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_374">[p. 374]</span> an empire as splendid and intellectual as
the elements of their religion and civilization would permit.</p>

<p>Much has been said concerning the glory of this empire, and the
effect it has produced on the literature and manners of modern times.
Long ago, a disposition was shown by Huet and Massieu to trace to
them the origin both of rhyme and of romantic fiction; but both
are now generally admitted to have been, as it were, spontaneous
productions of the human mind, which different nations at different
periods have invented separately for themselves.<a id="FNanchor_430"
href="#Footnote_430" class="fnanchor">[430]</a> Somewhat later, Father
Andres, a learned Spaniard, who wrote in Italy and in Italian, anxious
to give to his own country the honor of imparting to the rest of Europe
the first impulse to refinement after the fall of the Roman empire,
conceived the theory, at once broader and more definite than that of
Huet, that the poetry and cultivation of the Troubadours of Provence,
which are generally admitted to be the oldest of Southern Europe in
modern times, were derived entirely and immediately from the Arabs of
Spain; a theory which has been adopted by Ginguené, by Sismondi, and by
the authors of the “Literary History of France.”<a id="FNanchor_431"
href="#Footnote_431" class="fnanchor">[431]</a> But they all go
upon the presumption that rhyme and metrical composition, as well
as a poetic spirit, were awakened later in Provence than subsequent
inquiries show them to have been. For Father Andres and his followers
date the communication of the Arabian influences of Spain upon the
South of France from the cap<span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">[p.
375]</span>ture of Toledo in 1085, when, no doubt, there was a great
increase of intercourse between the two countries.<a id="FNanchor_432"
href="#Footnote_432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a> But Raynouard<a
id="FNanchor_433" href="#Footnote_433" class="fnanchor">[433]</a>
has since published the fragment of a poem, the manuscript of which
can hardly be dated so late as the year 1000, and has thus shown
that the Provençal literature is to be carried back above a century
earlier, and traced to the period of the gradual corruption of the
Latin, and the gradual formation of the modern language. The elder
Schlegel, too, has entered into the discussion of the theory itself,
and left little reason to doubt that Raynouard’s positions on the
subject are well founded.<a id="FNanchor_434" href="#Footnote_434"
class="fnanchor">[434]</a></p>

<p>But, though we cannot, with Father Andres and his followers, trace
the poetry and refinement of all the South of Europe in modern times
primarily or mainly to the Arabs of Spain, we must still, so far as the
Spanish language and literature are concerned, trace something to them.
For their progress in refinement was hardly less brilliant and rapid
than their progress in empire. The reigns of the two Abderrahmans, and
the period of the glory of Córdova, which began about 750 and continued
almost to the time of its conquest by the Christians in 1236, were more
intellectual than could then be found elsewhere; and if the kingdom of
Granada, which ended in 1492, was less refined, it was, perhaps, even
more splendid and luxurious.<a id="FNanchor_435" href="#Footnote_435"
class="fnanchor">[435]</a> The public schools and libraries of the
Spanish Arabs were resorted to, not only by those of their own
faith at home and in the East, but by Christians from different
parts of Europe; and Pope Sylvester the Sec<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_376">[p. 376]</span>ond, one of the most remarkable men of
his age, is believed to have owed his elevation to the pontificate to
the culture he received in Seville and Córdova.<a id="FNanchor_436"
href="#Footnote_436" class="fnanchor">[436]</a></p>

<p>In the midst of this flourishing empire lived large masses of
native Christians, who had not retreated with their hardy brethren
under Pelayo to the mountains of the Northwest, but dwelt among their
conquerors, protected by the wide toleration which the Mohammedan
religion originally prescribed and practised. Indeed, except that, as
a vanquished people, they paid double the tribute paid by Moors, and
that they were taxed for their Church property, these Christians were
little burdened or restrained, and were even permitted to have their
bishops, churches, and monasteries, and to be judged by their own laws
and their own tribunals, whenever the question at issue was one that
related only to themselves, unless it involved a capital punishment.<a
id="FNanchor_437" href="#Footnote_437" class="fnanchor">[437]</a>
But, though they were thus to a certain degree preserved as a
separate people, and though, considering their peculiar position,
they maintained, more than would be readily believed, their religious
loyalty, still the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">[p. 377]</span>
influence of a powerful and splendid empire, and of a population
every way more prosperous and refined than themselves, was constantly
pressing upon them. The inevitable result was, that, in the course of
ages, they gradually yielded something of their national character.
They came, at last, to wear the Moorish dress; they adopted Moorish
manners; and they served in the Moorish armies and in the places of
honor at the courts of Córdova and Granada. In all respects, indeed,
they deserved the name given to them, that of Mozárabes or Muçárabes,
persons who seemed to become Arabs in manners and language; for they
were so mingled with their conquerors and masters, that, in process of
time, they could be distinguished from the Arabs amidst whom they lived
by little except their faith.<a id="FNanchor_438" href="#Footnote_438"
class="fnanchor">[438]</a></p>

<p>The effect of all this on whatever of the language and literature
of Rome still survived among them was, of course, early apparent. The
natives of the soil who dwelt among the Moors soon neglected their
degraded Latin, and spoke Arabic. In 794, the conquerors thought
they might already venture to provide schools for teaching their
own language to their Chris<span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">[p.
378]</span>tian subjects, and require them to use no other.<a
id="FNanchor_439" href="#Footnote_439" class="fnanchor">[439]</a>
Alvarus Cordubensis, who wrote his “Indiculus Luminosus” in 854,<a
id="FNanchor_440" href="#Footnote_440" class="fnanchor">[440]</a>
and who is a competent witness on such a subject, shows that they
had succeeded; for he complains that, in his time, the Christians
neglected their Latin, and acquired Arabic to such an extent that
hardly one Christian in a thousand was to be found who could write a
Latin letter to a brother in the faith, while many were able to write
Arabic poetry so as to rival the Moors themselves.<a id="FNanchor_441"
href="#Footnote_441" class="fnanchor">[441]</a> Such, indeed, was the
early prevalence of the Arabic, that John, Bishop of Seville, one of
those venerable men who commanded the respect alike of Christians
and Mohammedans, found it necessary to translate the Scriptures
into it, because his flock could read them in no other language.<a
id="FNanchor_442" href="#Footnote_442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a> Even
the records of Christian churches were often kept in Arabic from this
period down through several succeeding centuries, and in the archives
of the cathedral at Toledo, above two thousand documents were recently
and are probably still to be seen, written chiefly by Christians and
ecclesiastics, in Arabic.<a id="FNanchor_443" href="#Footnote_443"
class="fnanchor">[443]</a></p>

<p>Nor was this state of things at once changed when the<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_379">[p. 379]</span> Christians from the
North prevailed again; for, after the reconquest of some of the
central portions of the country, the coins struck by Christian kings
to circulate among their Christian subjects were covered with Arabic
inscriptions, as may be seen in coins of Alfonso the Sixth and Alfonso
the Eighth, in the years 1185, 1186, 1191, 1192, 1199, and 1212.<a
id="FNanchor_444" href="#Footnote_444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a> And
in 1256 Alfonso the Wise, when, by a solemn decree dated at Burgos,
18th December, he was making provision for education at Seville,
established Arabic schools there, as well as Latin.<a id="FNanchor_445"
href="#Footnote_445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a> Indeed, still
later, and even down to the fourteenth century, the public acts and
monuments of that part of Spain were often written in Arabic, and the
signatures to important ecclesiastical documents, though the body
of the instrument might be in Latin or Spanish, were sometimes made
in the Arabic character, as they are in a grant of privileges by
Ferdinand the Fourth to the monks of Saint Clement.<a id="FNanchor_446"
href="#Footnote_446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a> So that almost as late
as the period of the conquest of Granada, and in some respects later,
it is plain that the language, manners, and civilization of the Arabs
were still much diffused among the Christian population of the centre
and South of Spain.</p>

<p>When, therefore, the Christians from the North, after a contest
the most bitter and protracted, had rescued the greater part of
their country from thraldom, and driven the Moors before them into
its southwestern provinces, they found themselves, as they advanced,
surrounded by large masses of their ancient countrymen, Christians,
indeed, in faith and feeling, though most imperfect in Christian
knowledge and morals, but Moors in dress, manners, and language. A
union, of course, took place between these different bodies, who,
by the fortunes of war, had been separated from each other so long,
that, though originally of the same stock and still connected by some
of the strongest sympathies of our nature, they had for centuries
ceased to possess a common language in which<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_380">[p. 380]</span> alone it would be possible to carry
on the daily intercourse of life. But such a reunion of the two
parts of the nation, wherever and whenever it occurred, necessarily
implied an immediate modification or accommodation of the language
that was to be used by both. No doubt, such a modification of the
Gothicized and corrupted Latin had been going on, in some degree,
from the time of the Moorish conquest. But now it was indispensable
that it should be completed. A considerable infusion of the Arabic,
therefore, quickly took place;<a id="FNanchor_447" href="#Footnote_447"
class="fnanchor">[447]</a> and the last important element was thus
added to the present Spanish, which has been polished and refined,
indeed, by subsequent centuries of progress in knowledge and
civilization, but is still, in its prominent features, the same that it
appeared soon after what, with characteristic nationality, is called
the Restoration of Spain.<a id="FNanchor_448" href="#Footnote_448"
class="fnanchor">[448]</a></p>

<p>The language, however, which was thus brought from the North by the
Christian conquerors, and became modified as it advanced among the
Moorish population of the South, was, as we have seen, by no means the
classical Latin. It was Latin corrupted, at first, by the causes which
had corrupted that language throughout the Roman empire, even before
the overthrow of the Roman power,—then by the inevitable effect of the
establishment in Spain of the Goths and other barbarians immediately
afterwards,—and subsequently by additions from the original Iberian
or Basque, made during the residence of the Christians, after the
Moorish conquest, among the mountaineers, with whom that language
had never ceased to prevail. But the principal cause of the final
degradation of the Latin at the North, after the middle of the eighth
century, was, no doubt, the miserable condition of the people<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_381">[p. 381]</span> who spoke it. They had
fled from the ruins of the Latinized kingdom of the Goths, pursued by
the fiery sword of the Moslem, and found themselves crowded together
in the wild fastnesses of the Biscayan and Asturian mountains. There,
deprived of the social institutions in which they had been nurtured,
and which, however impaired or ruined, yet represented and retained
to the last whatever of civilization had been left in their unhappy
country; mingled with a people who, down to that time, appear to have
shaken off little of the barbarism that had resisted alike the invasion
of the Romans and of the Goths; and pent up, in great numbers, within
a territory too small, too rude, and too poor to afford them the
means of a tolerable subsistence, the Christians at the North seem
to have sunk at once into a state nearly approaching that of savage
life,—a state, of course, in which no care or thought would be given
to preserve the purity of the language they spoke.<a id="FNanchor_449"
href="#Footnote_449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a> Nor was their condition
much more favorable for such purposes when, with the vigor of despair,
they began to recover the country they had lost. For they were then
constantly in arms and constantly amidst the perils and sufferings of
an exhausting warfare, embittered and exasperated by intense national
and religious hatreds. When, therefore, as they advanced with their
conquests towards the south and the east, they found themselves coming
successively in contact with those portions of their race that had
remained among the Moors, they felt that they were at once in the
presence of a civilization and refinement altogether superior to their
own.</p>

<p>The result was inevitable. The change, which, as has been said,
now took place in their language, was governed by this peculiar
circumstance in their position. For, as the Goths, between the
fifth and eighth centuries, received a vast number of words from
the Latin because it was the language of a<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_382">[p. 382]</span> people with whom they were intimately
mingled and who were much more intellectual and advanced than
themselves, so now, for the same reason, the whole nation received,
between the eighth and thirteenth centuries, another increase of
their vocabulary from the Arabic, and accommodated themselves, in
a remarkable degree, to the advanced cultivation of their Southern
countrymen and of their new Moorish subjects.</p>

<p>At what precise period the language, since called the Spanish
and Castilian, can be said to have been formed by this union of the
Gothicized and corrupted Latin that came from the North with the
Arabic of the South, cannot now be determined.<a id="FNanchor_450"
href="#Footnote_450" class="fnanchor">[450]</a> Such a union was, from
its nature, brought about by one of those gradual and silent changes in
what belongs essentially to the character of a whole people, which can
leave behind them no formal monuments or exact records. But the learned
Marina, who may perhaps be safely trusted on this point, asserts that
no document in the Castilian language, with a date anterior to the year
1140, exists, or, in his opinion, ever did exist.<a id="FNanchor_451"
href="#Footnote_451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a> Indeed the oldest yet
cited is a confirmation of privileges by Alfonso the Seventh, in the
year 1155, to the city of Avilés in Asturias.<a id="FNanchor_452"
href="#Footnote_452" class="fnanchor">[452]</a> However gradual,<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_383">[p. 383]</span> therefore, and indistinct
may have been the formation and first appearance of the Castilian as
the spoken language of modern<span class="pagenum" id="Page_384">[p.
384]</span> Spain, we may no doubt feel sure, that, about the middle
of the twelfth century, it had risen to the dignity of being a written
language, and had begun to appear in the important public documents of
the time.</p>

<p>From this period, then, we are to recognize the existence in Spain
of a language spreading gradually through the greater part of the
country, different from the pure or the corrupted Latin, and still
more different from the Arabic, yet obviously formed by a union of
both, modified by the analogies and spirit of the Gothic constructions
and dialects, and containing some remains of the vocabularies of the
Germanic tribes, of the Iberians, the Celts, and the Phœnicians, who,
at different periods, had occupied nearly or quite the whole of the
Peninsula. This language was called originally the <i>Romance</i>, because
it was so much formed out of the language of the Romans; just as the
Christians, in the northwestern mountains, were called by the Arabs
<i>Alromi</i>, because they were imagined to be descended from the Romans.<a
id="FNanchor_453" href="#Footnote_453" class="fnanchor">[453]</a>
Later, it was called <i>Spanish</i>, from the name taken by the whole
people, and perhaps, at last, it was even more frequently called
<i>Castilian</i>, from that portion of the country, whose political power
grew to be so predominant, as to give its dialect a preponderance over
all the other dialects, which, like the Galician, the Catalonian,<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_385">[p. 385]</span> and the Valencian, were,
for a longer or shorter period, written languages, each with claims to
a literature of its own.</p>

<p>The proportion of materials contributed by each of the languages
that enter into the composition of the Spanish has never been
accurately settled, though enough is known to permit an adjustment of
their general relations to each other. Sarmiento, who investigated the
subject with some care, thinks that six tenths of the present Castilian
are of Latin origin; one tenth Greek and ecclesiastical; one tenth
Northern; one tenth Arabic; and the remaining tenth East Indian and
American, Gypsy, modern German, French, and Italian. Probably this
estimate is not very far from the truth. But Larramendi and Humboldt
leave no doubt that the Basque should be added; and, while Marina’s
inquiries give a smaller proportion to the Arabic, those of Gayangos
raise it to an eighth. The main point, however, is one concerning which
there can be no doubt;—the broad foundations of the Castilian are to
be sought in the Latin, to which, in fact, we are to trace nearly
or quite all the contributions sometimes attributed to the Greek.<a
id="FNanchor_454" href="#Footnote_454" class="fnanchor">[454]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_386">[p. 386]</span></p> <p>The
Spanish, or Castilian, language thus formed was introduced into
general use sooner and more easily than, perhaps, any other of the
newly created languages, which, as the confusion of the Middle Ages
passed off, were springing up, throughout the South of Europe, to take
the place of the universal language of the Roman world. The reasons
of this were, that the necessity for its creation and employment was
more urgent, from the extraordinary relations between the Moors, the
Muçárabes, and the Christians; that the reign of Saint Ferdinand, at
least as late as the capture of Seville in 1247, was a period, if
not of quiet, yet of prosperity and almost of splendor; and that the
Latin, both as a written and a spoken language, had become so much
degraded, that it could offer less resistance to change in Spain than
in the other countries where a similar revolution was in progress.<a
id="FNanchor_455" href="#Footnote_455" class="fnanchor">[455]</a> We
must not be surprised, therefore, to find, not only specimens, but even
considerable monuments, of Spanish literature soon after the first
recognized appearance of the language itself. The narrative poem of
the Cid, for instance, cannot be dated later than the year 1200; and
Berceo, who flourished from 1220 to 1240, though he almost apologizes
for not writing in Latin,<a id="FNanchor_456" href="#Footnote_456"
class="fnanchor">[456]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_387">[p.
387]</span> and thus shows how certainly he lived in the debatable
period between the two languages, has left us a large mass of genuine
Spanish, or Castilian, verse. But it is a little later, and in
the reign of Alfonso the Tenth, from 1252 to 1282, that we are to
consider the introduction of the Spanish, as a written, a settled,
and a polite language, to have been recognized and completed. By his
order, the Bible was translated into it from the Vulgate; he required
all contracts and legal instruments to be written in it, and all law
proceedings to be held in it; and, finally, by his own remarkable
code, “Las Siete Partidas,” he at once laid the foundations for the
extension and establishment of its authority as far as the Spanish race
and power should prevail.<a id="FNanchor_457" href="#Footnote_457"
class="fnanchor">[457]</a> From this period, therefore, we are to look
for the history and development of the Spanish language, in the body of
Spanish literature.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> the earliest ballads were not by known
authors, but were gathered at different times, from the traditions
of the people, it is impossible to understand their history without
understanding something of the history of the Ballad-books in which
they are found. A sketch of such a history has been written, with
much knowledge of the subject, by Ferdinand Wolf, and is found in the
“Jahrbücher der Literatur” (Band CXIV., Wien, 1846, pp. 1-72). I do not
willingly enter into a discussion so peculiarly within the province of
this distinguished scholar; but, as I possess, or have seen, several
very early Ballad-books which he does not mention, and am besides
unable to agree with him as to which is the oldest of them all, and
therefore the most important, I will, as briefly as I can, give my
views of this obscure branch of bibliography; confining myself, where
it is possible to do so, to what has not before been published, and
touching the whole matter only so far as it concerns the history of
Spanish poetry.</p>

<p>A considerable number of ballads, printed on one or more sheets,
in black letter, for popular use, may still be found. Such are “El
Conde Alarcos”; “El Moro Calaynos”; a collection of twelve separate
pieces, and a collection of fifty-nine, sold at Heber’s sale; with
others noticed by Brunet, under the head of <i>Romances Séparées</i>,
in his article “Romanceros<span class="pagenum" id="Page_389">[p.
389]</span>.” But they are all without dates; it is extremely uncertain
when any one of them was printed; and it seems to me, judging from
those I have seen, to be more probable, that they were taken from
collections now known to exist or to have existed, than that they
helped to make up those collections,—the oldest of which claims to
have been taken from the memories of the people, and from imperfect
manuscript copies circulating only for popular use.</p>

<p>1. The first separate collection of ballads ever published was,
I think, the one printed at Saragossa, under the title of “Silva de
Varios Romances,” by Stevan G. de Nagera, in two parts, 1550. (See
Brunet, Manuel du Libraire, ed. 1843, art. <i>Silva</i>.) I have seen a
copy of this Silva belonging, in 1838, to M. Henri Ternaux-Compans, of
Paris. In a prefatory address to the First Part, the collector says, “I
have taken the trouble in this Silva to bring together all the ballads
that have come to my knowledge”; adding afterwards, “It may be that
some, though very few, of the old ballads are wanting, which I have not
inserted, either because they did not come to my knowledge, or because
I did not find them so complete and perfect as I wished. Nor do I deny,
that, in some of those here printed, there may be an occasional error;
but this is to be imputed to the copies from which I took them, which
were very corrupt, and to the weakness of memory of some persons, who
dictated them to me, and who could not recollect them perfectly. I did
all I could to obtain the least faulty that were to be had, and had no
little trouble to collect and amend them, and add to some that were
imperfect. However, I wished they should stand in some order, and so I
placed, first, those of devotion and from the Holy Scriptures; next,
those that relate Castilian stories; next, those of Troy; and, lastly,
those that relate to affairs of love.” After these ballads, which fill
one hundred and ninety-six leaves, he gives us twenty-five leaves of
<i>canciones</i>, <i>villancicos</i>, and <i>chistes</i>, or jests, among which, at
folio 199, is the well-known witty Dialogue of Castillejo and his Pen.
At the end of the First Part, folio 221, we have the following Address
to the Reader, in which the collector has evidently changed his mind
about having obtained all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_390">[p.
390]</span> but a “very few of the old ballads” known to exist; for
he now says: “Some of my friends, as they knew I was printing this
‘Cancionero,’ brought me <i>many</i> ballads, in order that I might insert
them; but as we were coming to the end of the printing, I chose not to
put them in, since they would interrupt the order that had been begun;
but rather to make another volume, which will be the Second Part of
this ‘Silva de Varios Romances,’ which is now in the press. Vale.”</p>

<p>This “Segunda Parte” was published in the same year, 1550, and
consists of two hundred and three leaves of ballads, nineteen leaves
of <i>chistes</i>, and two leaves of contents, at the end of which the
“Impresor” says: “I did not wish to put into this part any more of
those short <i>chistes</i>, because, if God pleases, they will be put into
the Third Part, with other things agreeable to the curious reader.
Vale.” I know of no copy of this Third Part; but it is possible it was
printed, because, in the “Silva de Varios Romances,” of which Wolf and
Brunet mention several editions between 1578 and 1673, and of which I
possess that of 1602, the title-page declares that it contains “los
mejores romances de los <i>tres</i> libros de la Silva.”</p>

<p>2. The first two parts, however, combined into one, but omitting the
<i>chistes</i>, etc., soon appeared at Antwerp, printed by Martin Nucio,
a well-known publisher, with considerable additions, but without the
date of its publication. The Preface is in nearly the same words with
that of the Silva of Nagera, Parte I.; but, when it announces the
arrangement of the ballads, it changes their order, and puts “first,
those that speak of France and the Twelve Peers; then, those that
relate Castilian stories; then, those of Troy; and, lastly, those
that treat of affairs of love.” Some of the ballads of the Saragossa
collection are omitted, and the whole is called “Cancionero de
Romances.” There is a copy of it in the Bibliothèque de l’Arsénal at
Paris; and that it is subsequent to the Saragossa Silva, and taken from
it, seems certain, because one <i>must</i> be taken from the other, and the
note at the end of the Silva, Parte I., shows that the Saragossa Silva
was collected and printed at <i>different</i> times; while the arrangement
of the ballads in the Cancionero of Antwerp shows that they were<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_391">[p. 391]</span> necessarily all present
to the editor when he put his work together. Besides, how should Nucio
collect ballads from the memories of the people around him at Antwerp,
where there were few Spaniards, except soldiers? And how much less
valuable would be any collection made there than one made in Spain?</p>

<p>3. Again, a “Cancionero de Romances” occurs, printed “En Envers en
casa de Martin Nucio, MDL.,” a copy of which is in the Bibliothèque
de l’Arsenal of Paris. It has the same Preface with the one last
mentioned, from which it differs only in omitting seven of its ballads,
and inserting thirty-seven others. The errors noted in the one without
date, at folios 272. b, etc., are corrected in this one, dated
1550, and prove it to be the subsequent edition of the two,—a fact
necessarily inferred, also, from the additions it contains.</p>

<p>4. This edition of 1550 seems to have been issued with different
title-pages, for Wolf says there is a copy of it in the Imperial
Library at Vienna, dated 1554. But nearly all the copies now known to
exist bear the date of 1555, under which this collection is best known,
and is commonly cited. It is absolutely the same work with the copy
at the Bibliothèque de l’Arsenal, dated 1550, ballad for ballad, and
page for page; and as there is no appearance that the title-page of
the copy at the Arsenal has been tampered with, we are to suppose that
three editions of the collection of ballads made at Saragossa in 1550
appeared in the course of that year; two of which were published by
Martin Nucio, at Antwerp. That all three are only one work is apparent
from the circumstance, that their ballads are generally the same, and
that they have the same Preface, a little changed in the second and
third editions to meet the changes in the ballads contained in them.
They are all in 18mo. The first, taking both its parts together,
fills four hundred and thirty-six leaves; the second, two hundred and
seventy-six; and the third, three hundred. Several reprints of the last
are given by Wolf; namely, Antwerp, 1568 and 1573; Lisbon, 1581; and
Barcelona, 1587 and 1626.</p>

<p>Subsequent to the Silva of Saragossa, we have several collections
of ballads, that are noticed in the text,—such<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_392">[p. 392]</span> as those of Sepulveda, 1551, Timoneda,
1573, Linares, 1573, Padilla, 1583, Maldonado, 1586, and Cueva,
1587,—consisting chiefly or entirely of ballads written by their
respective authors. At last, an attempt was made to gather another
Romancero from <i>all</i> the sources, whether of books, memory, or
tradition, that were open to its collectors,—the true principle on
which the popular Spanish Romanceros have always been compiled. It
seems to have been begun at Valencia, when the first volume of the
“Flor de Varios y Nuevos Romances, Primera y Segunda Parte,” collected
by Andrés de Villalta, with a Third Part by Felipe Mey,—himself
a poet and scholar as well as a printer,<a id="FNanchor_458"
href="#Footnote_458" class="fnanchor">[458]</a>—were printed in one
volume, in 1593, though each of them had, probably, been printed
earlier by itself. It is cited by Duran (Romances Caballarescos,
Madrid, 1832, 12mo, Tom. I., Advertencia); and from the ballads he
took out of it there can be no doubt, that its three parts differed
little from the first three parts of the “Romancero General” printed
somewhat later. The second volume of this collection, which is entitled
“Quarta y Quinta Parte de Flor de Romances,” was collected by Sebastian
Velez de Guevara, Racionero de la Colegial de Santander, and was
printed at Burgos, in 1594, 18mo, one hundred and ninety-one leaves.
It is apparently not the first edition, for the <i>Aprobacion</i> by Pedro
de Padilla, and a permission to print it, are dated 1592, while the
permission to print the present edition is dated August 11, 1594, and
says it has been “otras veces impreso.” Probably the two parts were
originally printed separately.</p>

<p>The third volume, and the most important, is entitled “Sexta Parte
de Flor de Romances Nuevos, recopilados de muchos Autores, por Pedro de
Flores, Librero,” and was printed at Toledo, in 1594, 18mo, one hundred
and ninety leaves. It is the first edition, but the license seems to
speak of a fourth and fifth part as if also made by Flores. In a ballad
prefixed to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_393">[p. 393]</span> this
third volume, Flores is accused before Apollo of having taken great
pains to collect its contents.</p>

<div class="poem mt1"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i8">“De diversas flores</p>
<p class="i0">Un ramillete ha juntado,</p>
<p class="i0">Las quales con grande afan,</p>
<p class="i0">De estrañas partes buscaron”;—</p>
</div></div>

<p class="ti0 mt1">to which, in a defence immediately following,
Flores replies, that “they were <i>stray</i> ballads [romances que andavan
descarriados], which he had brought together with great labor,” and
for which the god proceeds to reward rather than to punish him.
Flores adds, that he gives each ballad complete, and not like the
street-singers, who drawl out one half, and then say they are tired
of it. The whole account shows that many of the ballads in this Sixth
Part—which is excellent and contains a hundred and fifty-eight—were
collected from the memories of the people by Pedro Flores himself.</p>

<p>The fourth volume contains “Septima y Octava Parte de Flor de Varios
Romances Nuevos, recopilados de muchos Autores”; printed by Juan
Iñiguez de Lequerica, Alcalá de Henares, 1597, 18mo. There is a license
for each part; that of the first dated May 4, 1596, and recognizing it
as a reprint, and that of the second dated September 30, 1597, as if it
were the original edition, and entitling it “Flores del Parnaso, Octava
Parte.” The Seventh Part fills one hundred and sixty-eight leaves, and
the Eighth one hundred and thirty-two leaves, numbered separately.</p>

<p>The fifth and last volume is called “Flor de Varios Romances
diferentes de todos impresos, Novena Parte,” printed by Juan
Flamenco, Madrid, 1597, 18mo, one hundred and forty-four leaves. The
<i>Aprobacion</i>, 4th September, 1597, and the <i>Tassa</i>, 22d March, 1596,
speak of it as the eighth and ninth parts; but the license, without
date, is only for Part Ninth.</p>

<p>5. From these nine parts was made, with slight changes and
additions, chiefly toward the end, the first edition of the
“Romancero General,” which was printed at Madrid, 1600, 4to; the
<i>Tassa</i> being dated 16th December, 1599. A copy<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_394">[p. 394]</span> of it is in the National Library at
Madrid. A new edition—again with slight changes—appeared in 1602; and
another in 1604. This last was reprinted, without alteration, by Juan
de la Cuesta, at Madrid, in 1614. But Miguel de Madrigal had previously
published the “Segunda Parte del Romancero General y Flor de diversa
Poesía,” (Valladolid, 1605, 4to,) which may appropriately be added to
either of the last two editions of the principal work; and thus, from
nine parts, of which all four of the editions otherwise consist, extend
them to thirteen parts. All these editions are in small quarto, and
constitute the well-known “Romanceros Generales.”</p>

<p>The publication of so many different collections of ballads, in
the last half of the sixteenth century and the first years of the
seventeenth, leaves no doubt that ballads had then become known in
all classes of society, and were gradually finding favor with the
highest. But the Romanceros Generales were too large for popular use.
Smaller ballad-books, therefore, were printed; such as the “Jardin de
Amadores,” by Juan de la Puente, 1611; the “Primavera” of Pedro Arias
Perez, made with much judgment, and printed in 1626, 1659, etc.; the
“Maravillas del Parnaso” of Jorge Pinto de Morales, 1640; the “Romances
Varios” of Pablo de Val, 1655; and several others, to say nothing of
the many still less considerable collections, making only a sheet or
two, which are noticed by Depping and Wolf, and which were published to
meet the broad demands of the less cultivated portions of the Spanish
people, just as they have been published and republished down to our
own times. For similar reasons, though, perhaps, more to gratify
the military taste of the age, and afford amusement to the armies
in Flanders, Italy, and the Indies, selections were made from the
Romanceros Generales, and contributions obtained from other sources,
to make smaller and more convenient ballad-books of a stirring nature.
Such is the “Floresta de Romances de los Doce Pares de Francia,” by
Damian Lopez de Tortajada, the first edition of which was printed at
Alcalá in 1608, (Don Quixote, ed. Pellicer, 1797, 8vo, Tom. I. p. 105,)
and such is the “Romancero del Cid,” by Juan de Escobar, first printed
at Alcalá in 1612 (Antonio,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_395">[p.
395]</span> Bib. Nov., Tom. I. p. 684); both of which have often been
reprinted since.</p>

<p>But towards the end of the seventeenth century, a love for the
old Spanish ballads, as well as for the rest of the elder national
literature, began to decay in the more favored classes of society; and,
with the coming in of the eighteenth century and the Bourbon family, it
disappeared almost entirely. So strong a feeling, however, and one that
had struck its roots so deeply in the popular character, could not be
extirpated. The ballads were forgotten and neglected by the courtly and
the noble, but that the mass of the nation was as faithful to them as
ever we have the plain testimony of Sarmiento, and the fact, that they
were constantly reprinted for popular use in the humblest forms,—most
frequently in what are called <i>broadsides</i>. At last, an attempt was
made to replace them on their old ground. Fernandez, in 1796, printed
two volumes of them in his collection of Castilian poetry, and Quintana
made a small, but dainty, bouquet of them for his lyrical extracts in
1807, adding to each publication a Preface, which gave them praise high
and graceful, if not such as seemed to be imbued with their own earnest
spirit. Little effect, however, was yet produced at home, but some was
soon apparent abroad. Jacob Grimm published at Vienna, in 1815, a small
collection of the best old ballads, chiefly taken from the Romancero
of 1555; and C. B. Depping published at Leipzig, in 1817, a larger
one, containing above three hundred ballads, with a Preface and notes
in German, the whole of which was republished in Spanish, first, with
slight additions and corrections, at London, in 1825, by V. Salvá,
and secondly, with very large and important additions, at Leipzig, by
Depping himself and by A. A. Galiano, in 1844;—publications of great
merit, which have done more than all that had been done previously to
make the old Spanish ballads known in Europe generally, and which have
apparently called forth the admirably spirited translations of ballads
by J. G. Lockhart, 1823, and the interesting historically-arranged
French versions in prose of nearly three hundred, by Damas Hinard,
1844.</p>

<p>A very important publication of Spanish ballads in later<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_396">[p. 396]</span> times comes, however,
as it should come, from Spain itself, and was made by Don Agustin
Duran, to whom early Spanish literature, in other respects, owes much.
He began, in 1828, with the Moorish ballads in the Romancero General
of 1614, and went on, in 1829, with two volumes of miscellaneous
ballads, ending his labors, in 1832, with two volumes more, containing
historical ballads and ballads of chivalry;—in all, five volumes,—the
last four of which are collected from all the sources he could command
earlier than the middle of the seventeenth century, and the whole of
which, with additions, have been republished at Paris by Ochoa, in
1838, and at Barcelona by Pons, in 1840.</p>

<p>Still, a general, thorough, and critical collection of Spanish
ballads is wanting;—one embracing those of the known authors, like
Cueva, Padilla, Lope de Vega, Quevedo, and Góngora, as well as the
untold wealth that remains, and must always remain, anonymous in the
elder Romanceros. When we possess such a work, and not before, we can
understand and honor, as they deserve to be understood and honored,
the poetry and the nationality of the old Spanish ballads, upon which,
as upon its true foundations, rests the old Spanish drama. But to whom
shall we look for it? Is it to Duran at Madrid, or to Wolf at Vienna,
or to Huber at Berlin? I have intimations that one may be expected from
Duran, and hope they may soon be fulfilled.</p>

    “CENTON EPISTOLARIO.”</big></p>
  <p class="subh3 centra">(See Vol. I. p. 398.)</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">I have</span> treated the “Centon Epistolario”
in the text just as it has heretofore been treated; that is, as a
collection of the unstudied letters of a simple-hearted, vain man, who,
for above forty years, was attached to the person of John the Second,
and familiar with what was done at his court. Still, the exactness
and genuineness of the work have not been entirely unquestioned.
Mayans y Siscar (in his Orígenes, Tom. I., 1737, p. 203) speaks of
Antonio de Vera y Zuñiga, (see, <i>ante</i>, Vol. II. p. 500, Vol. III. <a
href="#Page_184">p. 184</a>,) the well-known author and diplomatist
of the time of Philip the Fourth, sometimes called Vera y Figueroa,
and says, “Feamente adulteró las epístolas históricas del Bachiller
Fernan Gomez de Ciudad Real,”—<i>He shamefully adulterated the historical
letters of the Bachelor Ferdinand Gomez de Cibdareal</i>; but Mayans gives
no reasons or facts to support this severe charge, and he is roundly
rebuked for it by Diosdado, (in his treatise “De Primâ Typographiæ
Hispanicæ Ætate,” Romæ, 1794, p. 74,) who calls it “an atrocious
calumny.” And again, Quintana, in his Life of Alvaro de Luna, (Vidas de
Españoles Célebres, Tom. III., 1833, p. 248, note,) is so much troubled
about some of the discrepancies between the Bachelor’s accounts of
the death of the Constable and the known facts of history, that he,
too, suggests all sorts of doubts, but ends by saying that he follows
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_398">[p. 398]</span> Bachelor’s
accounts as a sufficient authority where they are not directly
contradicted by others higher and safer.</p>

<p>My own opinion is, that the book is a forgery from beginning to end;
but a forgery so ingenious, so happy, so agreeable, that it may seem
an ungracious thing to tell the truth about it, or attempt to disturb
the position it has so long held in the Castilian literature of the
fifteenth century. The facts on which I ground my opinion are chiefly
these:—</p>

<p>1. No such person as the Bachelor Cibdareal is mentioned in the
chronicles or correspondence of the period during which he is supposed
to have lived, though our accounts from such sources are copious and
minute; noticing, I believe, everybody of consequence at the court of
John the Second, and certainly many persons of much less importance
than the king’s confidential physician.</p>

<p>2. No manuscript of the Letters is known to be in existence.</p>

<p>3. The first notice of them is, that they appear in an edition in
small quarto, black letter, one hundred and sixty-six pages, which
claims to have been printed at Burgos in 1499. Of this edition, few
copies have ever been seen. Antonio, who died in 1684, intimates (Bib.
Vetus, Tom. II. p. 250) a doubt about the truth of its date; Bayer,
in his note on the passage, 1788, says that learned men commonly
supposed that Antonio de Vera y Zuñiga, (who died in 1658,) published
this edition; and Mendez (in his Typographia, 1796, pp. 291 and 293)
declares the edition to be unquestionably half a century later than
its pretended date;—all three of these learned men being experts and
good witnesses concerning a fact, which, I think, must be obvious
to any person familiar with the earliest printed Spanish books, who
should look on a copy of it now before me. The name of the printer
on its title-page, Juan de Rei, it is important to add, is otherwise
suspected.</p>

<p>4. The next edition of the Letters of Cibdareal is that of Madrid,
1775, edited by Don Eugenio Llaguno y Amirola, Secretary of the Academy
of History, who thinks the first edition could not have been printed
till after 1600;—a circumstance otherwise probable, as I am not aware
that it is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_399">[p. 399]</span> cited by
any author of an earlier date. Indeed, if Antonio de Vera y Zuñiga had
any thing to do with it, we must suppose it to have been printed yet
later; for in 1600 that statesman was only about ten years old.</p>

<p>5. The Bachelor Cibdareal gives a date to no one of his letters; but
so completely are the facts or hints for them to be detected in the
Chronicle of John the Second, that the editor of the Letters in 1775
has been able, by means of that Chronicle, to affix its proper date
to every one, I believe, of the hundred and five letters of which the
collection consists. This would hardly be possible, if the two works
had been written quite independently of each other.</p>

<p>6. The style of the Letters, though certainly adapted with great
skill and felicity to its supposed period, is not uniformly true to it,
erring on the side of curious archaisms. Sometimes it goes further,
and uses words for which <i>no</i> example can be adduced. Thus the use of
<i>ca</i> in the sense of <i>than</i> is wholly unjustifiable; and wherever it
so occurs in the first edition, it is altered in the edition of 1775
to <i>que</i>, in order to make sense. Other errors more trifling might be
noticed; and in the spelling there is a systematical use of <i>c</i> for <i>z</i>
in words that never were spelt with a <i>c</i>.</p>

<p>7. The few words in the “Aviso al Letor,” and the still fewer that
introduce the verses at the end of the volume, profess to come from the
<i>Editor</i>, who, according to Bayer, Mendez, etc., lived after 1600, and
should, therefore, have written in the style of the period when Mariana
and Cervantes flourished. But he writes exactly in the style of the
Letters he edits, which claim to be a century and a half older; and,
what is worse, he uses in his own person the <i>ca</i> for <i>que</i>, which, as
we have noticed, nobody else ever used, except his Bachelor.</p>

<p>8. All accounts represent Juan de Mena as having died at Torrelaguna
in 1456, at the age of forty-five. (Antonio, Bib. Vetus, ed. Bayer,
Tom. II. p. 266; and Romero, Epicedio, 1578, f. 486, at the end of
Hernan Nuñez, Proverbios.) Now the supposed Cibdareal (Epist. 20)
places Juan de Mena, in 1428,—when he was, of course, only seventeen
years old,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_400">[p. 400]</span>—on the
most familiar footing at court, and makes him already historiographer
to the king, and far advanced in his principal poem;—a statement the
more incredible when we recollect that Romero says expressly, that Mena
was twenty-three years old when he first gave himself to “the sweet
labor of good learning,”—“al dulce trabajo de aquel buen saber.” See
the notice of Juan de Mena, <i>ante</i>, Vol. I. pp. 379-388.</p>

<p>9. The contemptuous account Cibdareal gives of Barrientos is not one
which a courtier in his position would be likely to give of a person
already of great consequence, and rising fast to the highest places
in the government. But, what is more, it is not the true account. He
represents that distinguished ecclesiastic, as we have seen, (<i>ante</i>,
Vol. I. p. 359,) to have burnt, in a very rash and reckless manner, a
large quantity of books, from the library of the Marquis of Villena,
sent to him for examination after the death of their owner, because he
had been accused, in his lifetime, of studying magic,—Barrientos, as
Cibdareal would have us believe, knowing nothing about the contents of
the books, which he burnt, at once, only because he would not take the
trouble to examine them. Now I happen to possess, in an unpublished
manuscript of Barrientos, his own account of this very matter. It is
in a learned treatise on Divination, which he wrote by order of John
the Second, and addressed to that monarch; and in the Preface to the
Second Part of which he declares that he burnt the books in question
<i>by the royal order</i>, and intimates, that, in his own opinion, they
should have been spared. “And this book,” he says, speaking of the one
called “Raziel,” to which I have alluded, (<i>ante</i>, Vol. I, p. 359,
note,) “this book is the one, which, after the death of Don Enrique
[de Villena], you, <i>as king</i>, commanded me, your servant and creature,
to burn, with many others, which I did, in presence of sundry of your
servants;—a matter in which, as in many other things, you showed and
still show the great devotion your Highness has always had for the
Christian religion. And, although this was and is to be praised, still,
for other respects, it is good in some way to preserve such books,
provided they are in the hands<span class="pagenum" id="Page_401">[p.
401]</span> and power of good, trustworthy persons, who will take heed
that they be read by none but wise men,” etc.;—a very different account
certainly from the one given in the letter of Cibdareal, and one which,
being addressed to the king, who was necessarily acquainted with the
whole transaction, can hardly have been untrue.</p>

<p>10. The most considerable event recorded in the Letters of
Cibdareal, and one of the most considerable occurrences in Spain during
the fifteenth century, is the execution of the Constable Alvaro de
Luna, at Valladolid, June 2, 1452. The Bachelor says, he was with the
king in that city the day it happened and the night preceding; that the
king showed great irresolution as to the fulfilment of the sentence
up to the last moment; that he had a sorrowful and sleepless night
before it occurred; and that nobody dared to tell him the execution
was absolutely over till he had eaten his dinner;—adding to these
striking statements sundry picturesque local details, as if they had
come within his own knowledge by his witnessing the execution. Now the
truth is, that the king was not in Valladolid on that day, nor for
some days before and after; and it would have been a very hard-hearted
thing if he had been there at the moment when his old friend and
favorite minister of state, to whom he never ceased to be attached, was
brought to the scaffold, in order to satisfy the turbulent nobility
whom he had oppressed. The king was, in fact, then at the siege of
Maqueda, a little town northwest of Toledo, above eighty miles off,
as appears by his letters still extant, dated May 29, June 2, 3, 4,
5, 6, etc.; so that many of the circumstances recorded in Cibdareal’s
letter (the 103d) are necessarily untrue. Moreover, the supposed
Cibdareal places the execution of the Constable on the eve of Saint
Mary Magdalen,—“Víspera de la Magdalena,”—confounding it with the date
of the death of the king, which happened on that day the next year,
and thus placing it on the 21st of July, which was the eve of Saint
Mary Magdalen, instead of the 2d of June, which, after some discussion,
long since the time when these Letters were first printed, has been
determined to be the true day of the execution. This gross<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_402">[p. 402]</span> mistake in the Letters
about the date of the Constable’s death was made, I suppose, in
part from carelessness, and in part because that date was not then
settled, as it is now. (See Mendez, Typographia, 1796, pp. 256-260; and
Quintana, Vidas, Tom. III. pp. 437-439.)</p>

<p>11. The age in which I suppose the Letters of Cibdareal to have
been forged was one in which such attempts were likely to be made. It
was in Spain an age of forgeries. Guevara had just before maintained
his “Marcus Aurelius” to be true history. (See, <i>ante</i>, Vol. I. p.
541.) The “Leaden Books” of Granada, and the “Chronicones” of Father
Higuera,—the first decided by the whole civil authority of the realm
to be genuine, and the second received as such by a very general
consent,—were, from 1595 to 1652, at the height of their success,
though both have long since been admitted to be gross frauds, which
acute scholars like Montano, and historians like Mariana, must, indeed,
have seen through, and were too high-minded to countenance; but which,
it should be remembered, they did not feel strong enough openly to
resist and denounce. In this state of opinion in Spain, some ingenious
scholar—perhaps Vera y Zuñiga—as clear-sighted as they were and only
a little less scrupulous, may well have been encouraged to imitate
Father Higuera in a matter which, instead of being an attempt, like
his, to bring false records concerning important affairs into the
history of the kingdom, may have been regarded merely as a literary
<i>jeu d’esprit</i>, intended to mislead nobody on any point except merely
that of the genuineness of the correspondence. (See, <i>ante</i>, Vol. III.
<a href="#Footnote_212">p. 152, note</a>.)</p>

<p>Against all this may be urged the general simplicity and interesting
details of the Letters themselves, so appropriate in their tone to
the age they illustrate, and the fact, that for above two centuries
they have been cited as the highest authority for the events of which
they speak; a fact, however, whose importance is diminished when we
recollect how rarely a spirit of criticism has shown itself in Spanish
historical literature, and that even in Spanish poetry the case of
the Bachiller de la Torre is, in some respects, as strong as that of
the Ba<span class="pagenum" id="Page_403">[p. 403]</span>chiller de
Cibdareal, and in others yet stronger. At any rate, all we know with
tolerable certainty about the Bachelor Cibdareal is, that the first
edition of his Letters is a forgery, intended to conceal something, and
more likely, I think, intended to conceal the spuriousness of the whole
than any thing else.</p>

  <p class="subh3 centra mt2"><big>ON THE BUSCAPIÉ.</big></p>
  <p class="subh3 centra">(See Vol. II. pp. 105, etc.)</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">A good</span> deal has been said within the last
seventy years, and especially of late, (1847-49,) about a pamphlet
entitled “<i>El Buscapié</i>,”—“The Squib,” or “Search-foot,”—supposed
by some persons to have been written by Cervantes, soon after the
publication of the First Part of his Don Quixote. The subject, though
not one of great consequence, is certainly not without interest, and
the facts in relation to it are, I believe, as follows.</p>

<p>In the Life of Cervantes, by Vicente de los Rios, prefixed to
the magnificent edition of the Don Quixote published by the Spanish
Academy in 1780, (see, <i>ante</i>, Vol. II. p. 52,) it is stated, that,
on the appearance of the First Part of that romance, in 1605, the
public having, according to a tradition not, I think, earlier recorded,
received it with coldness or censure, the author himself <i>published</i> an
<i>anonymous</i> pamphlet, called “The Squib,” in which he gave a pleasant
critique on his Don Quixote, insinuating that it was a covert satire on
sundry well-known and important personages, without, however, in the
slightest degree intimating who those personages were; in consequence
of which, the public curiosity became much excited, and the Don Quixote
obtained such attention as it needed in order to insure its success.
(Tom. I. p. xvii.)</p>

<p>In a note appended (p. cxci.) to this statement of the tradition, we
have a letter of Don Antonio Ruydiaz,—a person of<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_405">[p. 405]</span> whom little or nothing is now known,
except that Don Vicente declares him to have been a man of learning
worthy of credit,—in which letter, under date of December 16, 1775,
Don Antonio asserts, that, about sixteen years earlier, he had seen
a copy of the Buscapié at the house of the Count of Salceda, and had
read it;—that it was a small <i>anonymous</i> volume, <i>printed</i> at Madrid
with a good type and on poor paper;—that it pretended to be written
by a person who had neglected to buy or read the Don Quixote for some
time after its first appearance, but who, having at last bought and
read it, had been filled with admiration at its merits and resolved
in consequence to make them known;—that this Buscapié declared the
characters in the Don Quixote to be, in the main, imaginary, but
yet insinuated that they had certain relations to the designs and
gallantries of the Emperor Charles the Fifth, and of some of the
principal personages in his government;—and that the Count de Salceda
being dead, and the copy of the Buscapié in question having been only
lent to that nobleman by some person unknown to the writer of the
letter, he could give no further account of the matter.</p>

<p>This statement, differing, it will be noted, from the tradition
recorded in the text to which it is appended, in what relates to the
Emperor Charles the Fifth, was not, on the whole, deemed satisfactory.
Pellicer, besides other strong doubts, doubted whether Cervantes wrote
the pamphlet, even if all the rest related of it were true, (Don
Quixote, ed. 1797, Tom. I. p. xcvii.,) and Navarrete inclined to the
opinion, that there was some mistake about the whole affair, and that
Cervantes could never have intended to allude to the Emperor in the way
intimated (Vida de Cervantes, 1819, § 105, etc.); to which Clemencin
has since added the suggestion, that the copy of the Buscapié, alleged
to have been seen by Ruydiaz, might have been a forgery cunningly
imposed on the Count of Salceda, who was “rich and greedy”—<i>rico y
goloso</i>—in such matters (ed. D. Quixote, Tom. IV., 1835, p. 50).
Indeed, the intimations concerning Charles the Fifth were so absurd
in themselves, and the fact,—unknown when the Academy published their
edition of 1780,—that <i>four</i> editions of the First Part of Don Quixote
were, with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_406">[p. 406]</span>in a
year from the date of its appearance, demanded in order to satisfy
the impatient curiosity of the public, is so decisive of its popular
success from the outset, that men were, before long, disposed to
believe that there never was a Buscapié written by any body. After a
time, therefore, the discussion about it ceased, except among those who
were interested in the smallest details of the life of Cervantes.</p>

<p>But in 1847 the whole subject came up afresh. Don Adolfo de Castro,
a young Andalusian gentleman, much devoted to researches in early
Spanish literature, and the author of several curious historical works,
which give proof of his success, declared that he had accidentally
found a copy of the Buscapié. In 1848 he published it at Cadiz, in
a duodecimo volume, with a body of very learned notes,—the text, in
large type, making forty-six pages, and the notes one hundred and
eighty-eight pages, which, if printed with the same type, would make
above two hundred and fifty.</p>

<p>In the Preface, Don Adolfo declares, that the Buscapié he thus
publishes was printed from a <i>manuscript</i> which he had obtained from
the library of Don Pascual de Gándara, a lawyer of the city of San
Fernando, which library, apparently after the death of its owner, had
been brought, less than three months before, to the city of Cadiz, the
residence of Don Adolfo, to be publicly sold;—that the title of the
manuscript, which purports throughout to be the work of Cervantes, is
“The very pleasant little Book, called the Squib, in which, besides
its much and excellent Learning, are explained all the hidden and
unexplained Matters in the Ingenious Knight, Don Quixote de la Mancha,
written by a certain Cervantes de Saavedra”;—that the manuscript in
question is not in the handwriting of Cervantes, but, as appears by
a memorandum following the title, is a copy made at Madrid, February
27, 1606, for Agostin de Molina, son of Argote de Molina, and that it
had subsequently come into the possession of the Duke of Lafões, of
the royal family of Braganza;—that it contains no allusion whatever
disrespectful to the Emperor Charles the Fifth, for whom, as Don Adolfo
believes, Cervantes had a sincere admiration;—that it was, according to
the <i>Aprobacion</i> of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_407">[p. 407]</span>
Gutierre de Cetina, June 27, 1605, and that of Thomas Gracian Dantisco,
on the 6th of August following, prepared for the press, but that it was
not in fact printed, or it would not have been needful to make a copy
of it in manuscript the next year;—and that the true and real object
of the Squib was, not to attract attention to the Don Quixote, but to
defend that work against many persons accounted learned, who, as Don
Adolfo suggests, had attacked it with some severity.</p>

<p>In the Buscapié, which immediately follows these statements,
Cervantes represents himself as riding on his mule one day upon the
road to Toledo, a little beyond the Puente Toledana, when he sees
coming towards him a Bachelor mounted on a sorry hack, that at last
falls with him to the ground, in the midst of a contest between
the beast and his rider, as to whether they shall go on or no.
Cervantes courteously helps the stranger to rise; and then, after
a few introductory words, they agree to spend together, under some
neighbouring trees, the heat of the day, then fast coming upon them.
The Bachelor, a foolish, conceited little fellow, with a very deformed
person, produces two books for their common entertainment. The first
of them is “The Spiritual Verses of Pedro de <i>Ezinas</i>,” which they
both praise, and of whose author Cervantes speaks as of a personal
acquaintance. The other is the Don Quixote, which the Bachelor treats
very slightingly, and which Cervantes, a little disturbed by such
contempt, maintains, in general terms, to be a book of merit, not
hinting, however, to the Bachelor that he is its author, and putting
his defence on the ground, that it is a well-intended attempt to drive
the institution of chivalry from the world.</p>

<p>But the vain, garrulous little Bachelor prefers to talk about
himself or to tell stories about his father, and is with difficulty
brought back to the Don Quixote, which he then assails as a book
absurdly recognizing the existence of knight-errantry at the time it
was published, and therefore at the very time when they are talking
about it,—a position which Cervantes fully admits and then defends,
alleging, in proof of its truth, the examples of Suero de Quiñones and
Charles the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_408">[p. 408]</span> Fifth;
while, on the other side, the Bachelor sets forth, how glad he should
be if it were really so, because he would then turn knight himself,
and come by a princess and a kingdom as other knights had done before
him;—all in a strain as crazy as that of the hero of Cervantes, and
sometimes much resembling it. Cervantes replies, maintaining the real,
actual existence of knight-errantry in his own time by the examples
of Olivier de Lamarche and others, which are as little to the purpose
as those of Quiñones and the Emperor Charles the Fifth, already cited
by him; and so the discussion goes on, until a scene occurs between
the hack of the Bachelor and the mule of Cervantes, not unlike that
between Rozinante and the horse-flesh of the Galician carriers, in the
fifteenth chapter of the First Part of Don Quixote, and one that ends
with the total overthrow and demolition of the Bachelor’s beast. This
breaks up the conversation between their two riders, and brings the
pamphlet to a conclusion,—Cervantes leaving the unlucky Bachelor to get
out of his troubles as best he may.</p>

<p>On closing this gay little trifle, we are at once struck with the
circumstance, that the Buscapié we have just read, avowing itself on
every page to be <i>the work of Cervantes</i>, and declared <i>never to have
been printed</i> till the year 1848, can have nothing at all to do with
the <i>anonymous</i> Buscapié of which a <i>printed</i> copy is supposed to have
been seen about the year 1759;—in fact, that it involves a formal and
complete contradiction of every thing of consequence that was ever
said or supposed on the subject, before it appeared. This simplifies
the matter very much. It is as if a Buscapié had never before been
mentioned, and we are therefore to examine the one now published by
Don Adolfo de Castro as if the statement of Los Rios and the letter of
Ruydiaz had never appeared.</p>

<p>The next thing that occurs to us is the strangeness of the
circumstance, that the copy of such a work, not anonymous, but
professing to have been written by the greatest and most popular genius
of his nation, should, during two centuries and a half, have attracted
nobody’s notice; though, during that time, it must have travelled from
Madrid to Lisbon and from Lisbon back again to Spain, and though,
during the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_409">[p. 409]</span> last
seventy years, a Buscapié has been much talked about and eagerly asked
for.</p>

<p>Nor is the history of the individual manuscript now printed
and offered to us, so far as it professes to have a history, more
satisfactory. It claims to have been owned by three persons, and a word
must be said about each of them.</p>

<p>First, it is said to have been “copied from another copy in the
year 1606, at Madrid, on the 27th of February of the said year, for
Señor Agustin de Argote, son of the very noble Señor (may he be in
holy glory!) Gonzalo Zatieco de Molina, a knight of Seville.”<a
id="FNanchor_459" href="#Footnote_459" class="fnanchor">[459]</a> Now,
that Argote Zatieco de Molina, a person I have often had occasion
to mention, (see, <i>ante</i>, Vol. I. pp. 74, 75, 77, 117, etc.,) was,
as this certificate sets forth, dead in 1606, I have no doubt. A
manuscript copy of his well-known hints for the history of Seville,
now in the possession of one of my friends, contains notices and
documents relating to his life, collected, apparently, by the early
copyist, from which we learn that Argote de Molina, by a deed dated
July 5, 1597, left to his daughter, two sisters, and a brother the
patronage of a chaplaincy he had founded in a chapel prepared by
him for his burial-place in the church of Santiago, at Seville;<a
id="FNanchor_460" href="#Footnote_460" class="fnanchor">[460]</a> and
that in 1600 this chapel was completed, and an inscription placed in
it, signifying that it was the burial-place of Argote de Molina, late a
chief of the Hermandad, and a Veintequatro, or Regidor, of Seville;<a
id="FNanchor_461" href="#Footnote_461" class="fnanchor">[461]</a> from
all which, as well as from other grounds, it appears that Argote de
Molina died between 1597 and 1600. But why is no <i>son</i> of his mentioned
in the deed of 1597, providing for the care<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_410">[p. 410]</span> of his chapel and the protection of his
family burial-place after his own death? This is explained by Ortiz
de Zuñiga, the very best authority on such a point, who, when giving
an account of Argote de Molina and his manuscripts, some of which
Zuñiga had then in his possession, says that Argote de Molina had
sons, but that they died before him, and that their loss so embittered
the latter part of his life, that his reason was impaired by it.<a
id="FNanchor_462" href="#Footnote_462" class="fnanchor">[462]</a> What,
then, are we to say about this “Agustin,” for whom Don Adolfo’s copy of
the Buscapié is certified to have been made in 1606, <i>after</i> the death
of his father, Argote, who died without leaving any son?</p>

<p>The second trace of this manuscript is, that it professes
to have been a part of the library of the Duke of Lafões; the
inscription to this effect being in Portuguese, and without a date.<a
id="FNanchor_463" href="#Footnote_463" class="fnanchor">[463]</a> But
is it likely that such a manuscript could have remained in such a
position unnoticed? Is it likely that João de Braganza, one of the most
cultivated and distinguished men of his time, who was born in 1719,
and died in 1806; who was the friend of the Prince de Ligne, of Maria
Theresa, and of Frederic the Great; who founded the Academy of Lisbon,
and was its head till his death; in whose family lived Correa de Serra,
and who every evening collected the chief men of letters of his country
in his saloon,—is it likely that a work avowedly by Cervantes, and
one concerning which, after 1780, the Spanish Academy had caused much
inquiry to be made, should have remained in the library of such a man
without attracting, during his long life, either his own notice or
that of the scholars by whom he was surrounded? Or, finally, as to the
third and last presumed possessor of this manuscript of the Buscapié,
is it likely that it would have wandered on without being recognized
by any body until it found its obscure way into the collection of an
Andalusian advocate,—Don Pas<span class="pagenum" id="Page_411">[p.
411]</span>cual de Gándara,—and that even <i>he</i>, in the nineteenth
century, when Navarrete and Clemencin were keeping alive the discussion
of the eighteenth about it, should yet know nothing of its import or
pretensions, or, knowing them, should withhold his knowledge from all
the world?</p>

<p>Thus much for the external evidence, the whole of which, I believe,
I have examined. It is, as it seems to me, very suspicious and
unsatisfactory.</p>

<p>Nor can the internal evidence be accounted more satisfactory than
the external.</p>

<p>In the first place, the Buscapié in question is a closer imitation
of Cervantes than he would be likely to make of himself. It opens like
the Prólogo to the “Persiles and Sigismunda,” in which the conversation
that Cervantes says he held with a travelling medical student seems
to have been the model for the one he is represented as holding
with the travelling Bachelor in the Buscapié;—it then goes on with
an examination of one or two contemporary authors, and allusions to
others, in the manner of the scrutiny of Don Quixote’s library;—and
it ends with an acknowledged parallel to the story of the Yanguese
carriers and their beasts; different parts of the whole reminding
us of different works of Cervantes, but of the “Adjunta al Parnaso”
oftener than of any other. In many cases, phrases seem to be borrowed
directly from Cervantes. Thus, of an author praised in the Buscapié,
it is said, “Se atreve á competir con los mas famosos de Italia,” (p.
20,) which is nearly the phrase applied to Rufo, Ercilla, and Virues
in the Don Quixote. In another place, (p. 22,) Cervantes is made to
say of himself, when speaking in the third person of the author of Don
Quixote, “Su autor esta mas cargado de desdichas que de años,” which
strongly resembles the more beautiful phrase he, in the same way,
applies to himself, as the author of the “Galatea”; and in another
place, (p. 10,) the little Bachelor’s shouts to his mule are said to be
as much wasted “as if they were tossed into the well of Airon, or the
pit of Cabra,”—an allusion much more appropriately made by Cervantes
in the “Adjunta al Parnaso,” where mothers are advised to threaten
their naugh<span class="pagenum" id="Page_412">[p. 412]</span>ty
children, that “the poet shall come and toss them, together with his
bad verses, into the pit of Cabra, or the well of Airon,”—natural caves
in the kingdoms of Granada and Córdova, about which strange stories
were long credited. (Semanario Pintoresco, 1839, p. 25; Diccionario
de la Academia, 1726, <i>in verb.</i> Airon; Don Quixote, ed. Clemencin,
Tom. IV. p. 237; and Miñano, Diccionario Geográfico.) But there is no
need of citing parallel passages. The Buscapié is full of them; some
being happily chosen and aptly adjusted to their new places, like three
allusions to the words of Cervantes in Don Quixote about “driving books
of chivalry out of the world,” (see, <i>ante</i>, Vol. II. p. 105, note,)
and others, like those I have just cited, being awkwardly introduced,
and fitting their subjects less well than they did those to which they
were originally applied. But whether well or ill selected, whether well
or ill applied, these phrases in the Buscapié have seldom or never the
appearance of accidental coincidences arising out of the carelessness
of an author repeating from himself. They seem rather to be words and
forms of expression carefully selected, and are so used as to give
an air of constraint to the passages where they occur, showing that
the writer turns, as it were, in a narrow circle;—an air as unlike as
possible to the bold and unfettered movement which is so eminently
characteristic of Cervantes.</p>

<p>In the next place, the Buscapié contains many allusions to obscure
authors and long-forgotten trifles; but, with an inconsiderable
exception, which seems to be a little ostentatiously announced as
such, (p. 12, and note B,) not one, I believe, occurs, that is beyond
the reach of the singular learning of Don Adolfo, whose ample notes,
fitting with suspicious exactness to the text, drive the reader to the
conjecture, that the text may have been adjusted to the notes quite as
much as the notes to the text. Now and then, this conjecture seems to
be confirmed by a slight inaccuracy. Thus, in both text and notes, the
name of Pedro de E<i>n</i>zinas—whose poetry is cited and examined just as I
find it in my copy of the “Versos Espirituales,” printed at Cuenca, in
1596 (see, <i>ante</i>, Vol. III. <a href="#Footnote_14">p. 13, note</a>)—is
uniformly spelt <i>many times over</i> Ezinas, that is, with<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_413">[p. 413]</span>out the first <i>n</i>,
(Buscapié, pp. 19-21, and note I,)—a trifling mistake, which a copyist
might easily have made in 1606, or which Don Adolfo might have easily
made in 1847, when transcribing, as he did, from the printed book
before him, but a mistake which there is not one chance in a thousand
that <i>both</i> should have made, if there were no other connection between
the two than the one avowed. And, again, a little farther on, a mistake
occurs which seems to have arisen from the very excess of Don Adolfo’s
recondite learning. The old Castilian proverb, “Al buen callar llaman
<i>sage</i>,”—or, “He is a wise man that knows when to hold his tongue,”—is
found in the text of the Buscapié, (p. 26,) and Don Adolfo in the note
on it (L) informs us, that, “in the same way in which this proverb
is here used by Cervantes, it is to be seen in the Conde Lucanor,<a
id="FNanchor_464" href="#Footnote_464" class="fnanchor">[464]</a> and
in other older works. Somebody corrupted it into ‘Al buen callar llaman
<i>Sancho</i>.’” But the idea, that Cervantes adhered to an old form of the
proverb, because he rejected or did not know the supposed corrupt one,
is not well founded. The proverb occurs, in what Don Adolfo considers
a corrupted form, as early as the “Cartas de Garay,” in 1553, and the
collection of Proverbs by the learned Hernan Nuñez, in 1555, and <i>in
this very form it is, in fact, used by Cervantes himself</i> (Don Quixote,
Parte II. c. 43); for when Sancho Panza is rebuked by his master for
stringing together proverbs without end, he first promises he will
not utter another, and then instantly opens his mouth with this one.
Indeed, I rather think that the word <i>sage</i>, which was in use as late
as the time of Juan de Mena, had dropped out of the current language of
good society before that of Cervantes. Nebrixa, before 1500, says it
was then antiquated. (See Diccionario de la Academia, 1739.)</p>

<p>The last suggestion I have to make in relation to the genuineness of
the Buscapié published by Don Adolfo de Castro<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_414">[p. 414]</span> is, that, though on its title-page it
professes to explain “all the hidden and unexplained things” in the Don
Quixote, it does not, in fact, even allude to one such; and though it
professes to have been written by Cervantes in order to defend himself
against certain learned adversaries, it does not cite any one of them,
and only defends him in a light, jesting tone against the charge of
the little Bachelor by admitting its truth, and then justifying it, on
the ground that knight-errantry is still flourishing and vigorous in
Spain,—a charge which no sensible or learned man can be supposed to
have made, and a defence which is humorous, so far as it is so at all,
only for its absurdity.</p>

<p>Other things might be mentioned, such as that Cervantes, in
the Buscapié, is made to speak in a disparaging way of Alcalá de
Henares, his native place, (pp. 13 and 41,) which, as we have seen,
(<i>ante</i>, Vol. II. p. 53,) he delighted to honor; and that he is
made to represent his imaginary Bachelor as talking about his own
painful personal deformities, (pp. 24, 25, 28, 29,) and his father’s
contemptible poltroonery, (pp. 27, 28, 34,) in a way inconsistent with
the tact and knowledge of human nature which are among the strongest
characteristics of the author of Don Quixote.</p>

<p>But I will go no farther. The little tract published by Don Adolfo
de Castro is, with the exception of two or three coarse passages,<a
id="FNanchor_465" href="#Footnote_465" class="fnanchor">[465]</a> a
pleasant, witty trifle. It shows in many parts much lively talent, a
remarkable familiarity with the works of Cervantes, and a hardly less
remarkable familiarity with the literature of the period when Cervantes
lived. If Don Adolfo wrote it, he has probably always intended, in due
time, to claim it as his own, and he may be assured that, by so doing,
he will add something to his own literary laurels without taking any
thing from those of Cervantes. If he did not write it, then he has,
I think, been deceived in regard to the character of the manuscript,
which he purchased under circumstances<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_415">[p. 415]</span> that made him believe it to be what it is
not. In any event, I find no sufficient proof that it was written by
Cervantes, and therefore no sufficient ground to think that it can be
placed permanently under the protection of his great name.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Whatever</span> relates to the “Don Quixote” of
Cervantes is so interesting, that I will add here such an account of
its different editions, translations, and imitations as may serve, in
some degree, to give the just measure of its extraordinary popularity,
not only in Spain, but all over Christendom.</p>

<p>The first edition of the First Part of Don Quixote, of which I have
a copy, was printed with this title: “El Ingenioso Hidalgo, Don Quixote
de la Mancha, compuesto por Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra, dirigido al
Duque de Bejar, Marques de Gibraleon, etc. Año 1605. Con Privilegio,
etc. En Madrid, por Juan de la Cuesta,” 4to, in one volume. Three
editions more appeared in the same year, namely, one at Madrid, one at
Lisbon, and the other at Valencia. These, with another at Brussels, in
1607,—five in all,—are the only editions that appeared, till he took
it in hand to correct some of its errors. But he did this, as I have
intimated, very imperfectly and carelessly. Among other changes, he
did away with the division of the volume into four parts or books, but
did not take the trouble to remove from the text the proofs of such
a division, as may be seen at the end of Chapters VIII., XIV., and
XXVII., where the work was divided, and where, in all our editions,
the proofs of it still remain. Such corrections, however, as he saw
fit to make, with sometimes a different spelling<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_417">[p. 417]</span> of words, appeared in the Madrid edition
of 1608, 4to; of which I have a copy. This edition, though somewhat
better than the first, is yet ordinary; but, as the one containing
Cervantes’s only amendments of the text, it is more valued and
sought after than any other, and is the basis on which all the good
impressions since have been founded. After this, an edition at Milan,
1610, and one at Brussels, 1611, are known to have been printed before
the appearance of the Second Part, in 1615. So that, in nine or ten
years, there were eight editions of the First Part of Don Quixote,
implying a circulation greater than that of the works of Shakspeare or
Milton, Racine or Molière, who, as of the same century, may be fitly
compared with him.</p>

<p>The first edition of the Second Part of Don Quixote, which,
like the first edition of the First Part, is poorly printed, is
entitled, “Segunda Parte del Ingenioso Hidalgo Don Quixote de la
Mancha, por Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra, <i>autor de su Primera
Parte</i>, dirigida á Don Pedro Fernandez de Castro, Conde de Lemos,
etc. Año 1615. Con Privilegio, en Madrid, por Juan de la Cuesta,”
4to. It was printed separately, Valencia, 1616; Brussels, 1616;
Barcelona, 1617; and Lisbon, 1617; after which no separate edition
is known to have appeared.<a id="FNanchor_466" href="#Footnote_466"
class="fnanchor">[466]</a></p>

<p>Thus, as we have seen, eight editions of the First Part were printed
in ten years, and five of the Second Part in two years. Both parts
appeared together at Barcelona in 1617, in two volumes, duodecimo;
and from this period the number of editions has been very great, both
in Spain and in foreign countries; nearly fifty of them being of some
consequence. Only five, however, need to be here particularly noted.
These are,—1. Tonson’s edition, (London, 1738, 4 vols., 4to,) published
at the instance of Lord Carteret, in compliment to the queen, and
containing the Life by Mayans y Siscar, already noticed; the<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_418">[p. 418]</span> first attempt either
to edit Don Quixote or to write its author’s life with care. 2. The
magnificent edition printed by the Spanish Academy, (Madrid, 1780,
4 tom., folio,) in which the text is settled with some skill, a few
notes are added, and the Life of Cervantes and an Analysis, or rather
an extravagant eulogy and defence, of the Don Quixote, by Don Vicente
de los Rios, prefixed. It has been several times reprinted, though not
without expressions of disapprobation, especially at the indiscriminate
admiration of Los Rios, who found, among other opponents, a very
resolute one in a Spaniard by the name of Valentine Foronda, who, in
1807, printed in London a thin octavo volume of very captious notes on
Don Quixote, written in the form of letters, between 1793 and 1799, and
entitled “Observaciones sobre Algunos Puntos de la Obra de Don Quixote,
por T. E.” Clemencin gives the name of the author, who is otherwise
unknown to me. (Ed. Don Quixote, Tom. I. p. 305.) 3. The extraordinary
edition published in two volumes, quarto, at Salisbury, in England,
in 1781, and accompanied by a third volume, consisting of notes and
verbal indexes, all in Spanish, by the Rev. John Bowle, a clergyman in
a small village near Salisbury, who gave fourteen years of unwearied
labor to prepare it for the press; studying, as the basis of his system
of annotation, the old Spanish and Italian authors, and especially the
old Spanish ballad-books and books of chivalry, and concluding his
task, or at least dating his Prefaces and Dedication, on the 23d of
April, the anniversary of Cervantes’s death. There are few books of so
much real learning, and at the same time of so little pretension, as
the third volume of this edition. It is, in fact, the true and safe
foundation on which has been built much of what has since been done
with success for the explanation and illustration of the Don Quixote,
which thus owes more to Bowle than to any other of its editors, except
Clemencin. 4. The edition of Juan Antonio Pellicer, (Madrid, 1797-98,
5 tom., 8vo,) an Aragonese gentleman, who employed above twenty years
in preparing it. (Latassa, Bib. Nov., Tom. VI. p. 319.) The notes to
this edition contain a good deal of curious matter, but this matter is
often irrelevant; the number of the notes is small, and they ex<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_419">[p. 419]</span>plain only a small part of
the difficulties that occur in the text. It should be observed, too,
that Pellicer is indebted to Bowle further than he acknowledges, and
that he now and then makes mistakes on points of fact. 5. The edition
of Diego Clemencin, (Madrid, 1833-39, 6 tom., 4to,) one of the most
complete commentaries that has been published on any author, ancient
or modern. It is written, too, with taste and judgment in nearly all
that relates to the merits of the author, and is free from the blind
admiration for Cervantes which marks Vicente de los Rios and the
edition of the Academy. Its chief fault is, that there is too much of
it; but then, on the other hand, it is rare to find an obscure point
which it does not elucidate. The system of Clemencin is the one laid
down by Bowle; and the conscientious learning with which it is carried
out seems really to leave little to be desired in the way of notes.</p>

<p>In other countries the Don Quixote is hardly less known than it is
in Spain. Down to the year 1700, it is curious to observe, that as
many editions of the <i>entire</i> work were printed abroad as at home, and
the succession of translations from the first has been uninterrupted.
The oldest <i>French</i> translation is of 1620, since which there have
been six or seven others, including the poor one of Florian, 1799,
which has been the most read, and the very good one of Louis Viardot,
(Paris, 1836-38, 2 tom., 8vo,) with the admirable illustrations of
Granville,—a translation, however, which has been somewhat roughly
handled by F. B. F. Biedermann, in a tract entitled “Don Quixote et la
Tâche de ses Traducteurs” (Paris, 1837, 8vo). The oldest <i>English</i> one
is by Shelton, 1612-20, the first half of which was made, as he says
in the Dedication, in forty days, some years before, and which was
followed by a very vulgar, unfaithful, and coarse one by John Philips,
the nephew of Milton, 1687; one by Motteux, 1712; one by Jarvis, 1742,
which Smollet used too freely in his own, 1755; one by Wilmot, 1774;
and, finally, the anonymous one of 1818, which has adopted parts of all
its predecessors. Most of them have been reprinted often; and, on the
whole, the most agreeable and the best, though certainly somewhat too
free, is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_420">[p. 420]</span> that of
Motteux, in the edition of Edinburgh, 1822, (5 vols., 12mo,) with notes
and illustrative translations, full of spirit and grace, by Mr. J. G.
Lockhart. No foreign country has done so much for Cervantes and Don
Quixote as England, both by original editions, published there, and by
translations. It may be noticed further, that, in 1654, Edmund Gayton,
a gay fellow about town, of whom Wood gives no very dignified account,
published in London a small folio volume, entitled “Pleasant Notes upon
Don Quixote,” the best of its author’s various works, and one that was
thought worth publishing again in the next century, for the sake, I
suppose, of the amusing vein in which it is written, but not on account
of any thing it contains that will serve to explain difficult or
obscure passages in the original. Some of it is in verse, and the whole
is based on Shelton’s translation.</p>

<p>All countries, however, have sought the means of enjoying the Don
Quixote, for there are translations in Latin, Italian, Dutch, Danish,
Russian, Polish, and Portuguese. But better than any of these is,
probably, the admirable one made into <i>German</i> by Ludwig Tieck, with
extraordinary freedom and spirit, and a most genial comprehension of
his author; four editions of which appeared between 1815 and 1831, and
superseded all the other German versions, of which there are five,
beginning with an imperfect attempt in 1669. It ought, perhaps, to be
added, that, in the course of the last half-century, more editions
of the original have appeared in Germany than in any other foreign
country.</p>

<p>Of imitations out of Spain, it is only necessary to allude to
three. The first is a “Life of Don Quixote, merrily translated into
Hudibrastic Verse, by Edward Ward,” (London, 1711, 2 vols., 8vo,)—a
poor attempt, full of coarse jests not found in the original. The
second is “Don Silvio de Rosalva,” by Wieland, (1764, 2 vols.,) in
ridicule of a belief in fairies and unseen agencies;—his first work in
romantic fiction, and one that never had much success. The third is
a curious poem, in twelve cantos, by Meli, the best of the Sicilian
poets, who, in his native dialect, has endeavoured to tell the story
of Don Quixote in octave stanzas, with the<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_421">[p. 421]</span> heroi-comic lightness of Ariosto; but,
among other unhappinesses, has cumbered Sancho with Greek mythology
and ancient learning. It fills the third and fourth volumes of Meli’s
“Poesie Siciliane” (Palermo, 1787, 5 vols., 12mo). All these, as well
as Smollet’s “Sir Launcelot Graves” and Mrs. Lenox’s “Female Quixote,”
both published in 1762, are direct imitations of the Don Quixote, and
on that account, in part, they are all failures. Butler’s “Hudibras,”
(first edition, 1663-78,) so free and so full of wit, comes, perhaps,
as near its model as genius may venture with success.</p>

<p>Don Quixote has often been produced on the stage in Spain; as, for
instance, in a play by Francisco de Avila, published at Barcelona, in
1617; in two by Guillen de Castro, 1621; in one by Calderon, that is
lost; and in others by Gomez Labrador, Francisco Marti, Valladares,
Melendez Valdes, and, more lately, Ventura de la Vega; some of which
were noticed when we spoke of the drama. But all of them were failures.
(Don Quixote, ed. Clemencin, Tom. IV., 1835, p. 399, note.)</p>

<p>As to prose imitations in Spain, except the attempt of Avellaneda,
in 1614, I know of none for above a century;—none, indeed, till the
popularity of the original work was revived. But since that period,
there have been several. One is by Christóval Anzarena,—“Empressas
Literarias del ingeniosíssimo Cavallero, Don Quixote de la Manchuela,”
(Sevilla, 12mo, without the year, but printed about 1767,)—intended to
ridicule the literary taste of the times, which, after going through
the education of the hero, breaks off with the promise of a second
part, that never appeared. Another is called “Adiciones á Don Quixote,
por Jacinto María Delgado,” (Madrid, 12mo, s. a.,) printed apparently
soon after the last, and containing the remainder of Sancho’s life,
passed chiefly with the Duke and Duchess in Aragon, where, at a very
small expense of wit, he is fooled into the idea that he is a baron.
Another, by Alonso Bernardo Ribero y Sarrea, called “El Quixote de la
Cantabria,” (Madrid, 1792, 2 tom., 12mo,) describes the travels of a
certain Don Pelayo to Madrid, and his residence at court there, whence
he returns to his native moun<span class="pagenum" id="Page_422">[p.
422]</span>tains, astonished and shocked that the Biscayans are not
everywhere regarded as the only true nobility and gentlemen on earth.
A fourth, “Historia de Sancho Panza,” (Madrid, 1793-98, 2 tom., 12mo,)
is an unsuccessful attempt to give effect to Sancho as a separate and
independent person after Don Quixote’s death, making him Alcalde of his
native village, and sending him to figure in the capital and get into
prison there;—the whole bringing the poor esquire’s adventures down
to a very grave ending of his very merry life. And a fifth, by Juan
Siñeriz, “El Quixote del Siglo XVIII.,” (Madrid, 1836, 4 tom., 12mo,)
is an account of a French philosopher, who, with his esquire, travels
over the earth to regenerate mankind; and, coming back just at the
close of the French Revolution, which happened while he was in Asia, is
cured, by the results of that great convulsion, of his philosophical
notions; a dull, coarse book, whose style is as little attractive as
its story. Perhaps there are other Spanish imitations of Don Quixote;
but there can be none, I apprehend, of any merit or value.</p>

<p>All this account, however, incomplete as it is, of the different
editions, translations, and imitations which, for above two centuries,
have been poured out upon the different countries of Europe, gives,
still, but an imperfect measure of the kind and degree of success
which this extraordinary work has enjoyed; for there are thousands
and thousands who never have read it, and who never have heard of
Cervantes, to whom, nevertheless, the names of Don Quixote and of
Sancho are as familiar as household words. So much of this kind of fame
is enjoyed, probably, by no other author of modern times.</p>

  <p class="subh3 centra mt2"><big>ON THE EARLY COLLECTIONS OF OLD
    SPANISH PLAYS.</big></p>
  <p class="subh3 centra">(See Vol. II. p. 429.)</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Two</span> large collections of plays, and
several small ones, much resembling each other, both in the character
of their contents and the form of their publication, appeared in
different parts of Spain during the seventeenth century, just as the
ballads had appeared a century before; and they should be noticed
with some care, because they exhibit the peculiar physiognomy of the
Spanish national drama with much distinctness, and furnish materials of
consequence for its history.</p>

<p>Of the first collection, whose prevailing title seems to have been
“Comedias de Diferentes Autores,” it would, I suppose, be impossible
now to form a complete set, or one even approaching to completeness. I
possess only three volumes of it, and have seen satisfactory notices
of only two more. The first of the five is the twenty-fifth volume of
the collection itself, and was printed at Saragossa, in 1633, by Pedro
Escuer. As is usual with such volumes of the old Spanish dramatists,
it is in small quarto and contains twelve plays, seven of which are
attributed to Montalvan, then at the height of his success as a living
author, and one to Calderon, who was just rising to his great fame;
but one of the seven plays of Montalvan belongs to his master, Lope
de Vega, and the only one taken from Calderon is printed from a text
grossly corrupted. The twenty-ninth volume was printed at Valencia,
in 1636, and the thirty-second at Saragossa, in 1640; but I have seen
neither of them. In the thirty-first, printed at Barcelona,<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_424">[p. 424]</span> in 1638, all the twelve
plays are given without the names of their authors, though the persons
who wrote most of them are still known; and the forty-third volume was
printed at Saragossa, in 1650, containing plays by Calderon, Moreto,
and Solís, with enough by more obscure authors to make up the regular
number of twelve. It is no doubt singular, that, of a collection like
this, extending to at least forty-three volumes, so little should now
be known. But such is the fact. The Inquisition and the confessional
were very busy in the latter part of the seventeenth century, when,
under the imbecile Charles the Second, the theatre had fallen from
its high estate; and in this way the oldest large collection of plays
published in Spain, and the one we should now be most desirous to
possess, was hunted down and nearly exterminated.</p>

<p>The next, which is the collection commonly known under the title
of “Comedias Nuevas Escogidas de los Mejores Autores,”—a title by
no means strictly adhered to in its successive volumes,—was more
fortunate. Still it is very rare. I have never seen a set of it
absolutely complete; but I possess in all forty-one volumes out of the
forty-eight, of which such a set should consist, and have sufficiently
accurate notices of the remaining seven.</p>

<p>The first of these volumes was published in 1652, the last in 1704;
but, in the latter part of the period embraced between these dates,
the theatre so declined, that, though at first two or three volumes
came out every year, none was issued during the twenty-three years
that followed the death of Calderon in 1681, except the very last
in the collection, the forty-eighth. Taken together, they contain
five hundred and seventy-four <i>comedias</i>, in all the forms and with
all the characteristics of the old Spanish drama; their appropriate
<i>loas</i> and <i>entremeses</i> being connected with a very small number of
them. Thirty-seven of these <i>comedias</i> are given as anonymous, and
the remaining five hundred and thirty-seven are distributed among one
hundred and thirty-eight different authors.</p>

<p>The distribution, however, as might be anticipated, is very unequal.
Calderon, who was far the most successful writer of the period he
illustrated, has fifty-three plays assigned to<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_425">[p. 425]</span> him, in whole or in part, of which it
is certain not one was printed with his permission, and not one, so
far as I have compared them with the authentic editions of his works,
from a text properly corrected. Moreto, the dramatic writer next in
popularity after Calderon, has forty-six pieces given to him in the
same way; all probably without his assent, since he renounced the stage
as sinful, and retired to a monastery in 1657. Matos Fragoso, who was a
little later, has thirty-three; Fernando de Zarate, twenty-two; Antonio
Martinez, eighteen; Mira de Mescua, eighteen; Zavaleta, sixteen; Roxas,
sixteen; Luis Velez de Guevara, fifteen; Cancer, fourteen; Solís,
twelve; Lope de Vega, twelve; Diamante, twelve; Pedro de Rosete,
eleven; Belmonte, eleven; and Francisco de Villegas, eleven. Many
others have smaller numbers assigned to them; and sixty-nine authors,
nearly all of whose names are otherwise unknown, and some of them,
probably, not genuine, have but one each.</p>

<p>That the dramas in this collection all belong to the authors to
whom it ascribes them, or that it is even so far accurate in its
designations as to be taken for a sufficient general authority, is
not for a moment to be supposed. Thirteen at least of the plays it
contains, that bear the name of Calderon, are not his; one known to be
his, “La Banda y la Flor,” is printed as anonymous in the thirtieth
volume, with the title of “Hazer del Amor Agravio”; and another, “Amigo
Amante y Leal,” is twice inserted,—once in the fourth volume, 1653, and
once in the eighteenth volume, 1662,—each differing considerably from
the other, and neither taken from a genuine text.</p>

<p>Of its carelessness in relation to other authors similar remarks
might be made. Several of the plays of Solís are printed twice, and
one three times; and in two successive volumes, the twenty-fifth
and twenty-sixth, we have the “Lorenzo me llamo” of Matos Fragoso,
a well-known and, in its time, a popular play. On all accounts,
therefore, this collection, like its predecessor, is to be regarded
as a mere bookseller’s speculation, carried on without the consent
of the authors whose works were plundered for the purpose, and<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_426">[p. 426]</span> sometimes, as we know,
in disregard of their complaints and remonstrances. How recklessly
and scandalously this was done may be gathered from the facts already
stated, and from the further one, that the “Vencimiento de Turno,” in
the twelfth volume, which is boldly ascribed to Calderon on its title,
is yet given to its true author, Manuel del Campo, in the very lines
with which it is ended.</p>

<p>Still, these large collections, with the single volumes that, from
time to time, were sent forth in the same way by the booksellers,—such
as those published by Mateo de la Bastida, in 1652; by Manuel Lopez,
in 1653; by Juan de Valdes, in 1655; by Robles, in 1664; and by Zabra
and Fernandez, in 1675, all of which have been used in the account of
the theatre in the text,—give us a living and faithful impression of
the acted Spanish drama in the seventeenth century; for the plays they
contain are those that were everywhere performed on the national stage,
and they are here presented to us, not so often in the form given them
by their authors, as in the form in which they were fitted for the
stage by the managers, and plundered from the prompter’s manuscripts,
or noted down in the theatres, by piratical booksellers.</p>

  <p class="subh3 centra mt2"><big>ON THE ORIGIN OF THE BAD TASTE IN SPAIN,
    CALLED CULTISMO.</big></p>
  <p class="subh3 centra">(See Vol. II. p. 533, note.)</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">A remarkable</span> discussion took place in
Italy in the latter part of the eighteenth century, concerning the
origin of the bad taste in literature that existed in Spain after 1600,
under the name of “Cultismo”;—some of the distinguished men of letters
in each country casting the reproach of the whole of it upon the other.
The circumstances, which may be properly regarded as a part of Spanish
literary history, were the following.</p>

<p>In 1773, Saverio Bettinelli, a superficial, but somewhat popular,
writer, in his “Risorgimento d’Italia negli Studj, etc., dopo il
Mille,” charged Spain, and particularly the Spanish theatre, with the
bad taste that prevailed in Italy after that country fell so much under
Spanish control; adding to a slight notice of Lope de Vega and Calderon
the following words:—“This, then, is the taste which passed into
Italy, and there ruined every thing pure.” (Parte II. cap. 3, Tragedia
e Commedia.) Girolamo Tiraboschi, in his “Storia della Letteratura
Italiana,” first published between 1772 and 1783, maintained a similar
position or theory, tracing this bad taste, as it were, to the very
soil and climate of Spain, and following its footsteps, both in ancient
times, when, he believed, the Latin literature had been corrupted by it
after the Senecas and Martial came from Spain to Rome, and in modern
times,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_428">[p. 428]</span> when he
charged upon it the follies of Marini and all his school. (Tom. II.,
Dissertazione Preliminare, § 27.)</p>

<p>Both these writers were, no doubt, sufficiently decided in the tone
of their opinions. Neither of them, however, was harsh or violent in
his manner, and neither, probably, felt that he was making such an
attack on the literature and fair fame of another country as would
provoke a reply;—much less, one that would draw after it a long
controversy.</p>

<p>But at that period there were in Italy a considerable number of
learned Spaniards, who had been driven there, as Jesuits, by the
expulsion of their Society from Spain in 1767; men whose chief resource
and amusement were letters, and who, like true Spaniards, felt not a
whit the less proud of their country because they had been violently
expelled from it. With hardly a single exception, they seem to have
been offended by these and other similar remarks of Bettinelli and
Tiraboschi, to which they were, perhaps, only the more sensitive,
because the distinguished Italians who made them were, like themselves,
members of the persecuted Order of the Jesuits.</p>

<p>Answers to these imputations, therefore, soon began to appear. Two
were published in 1776;—the first by Thomas Serrano, a Valencian,
who, in some Latin Letters, printed at Ferrara, defended the Latin
poets of Spain from the accusations of Tiraboschi, (Ximeno, Tom. II.
p. 335; Fuster, Tom. II. p. 111,) and the second by Father Giovanni
Andres, who, in a Dissertation printed at Cremona, took similar ground,
which he further enlarged and fortified afterwards, in his great work
on universal literary history, (Dell’ Origine, Progresso, e Stato
Attuale di Ogni Letteratura, 1782-99, 9 tom., 4to,) where he maintains
the dignity and honor of his country’s literature on all points, and
endeavours to trace the origin of much of what is best in the early
culture of modern Europe to Arabian influences coming in from Spain,
through Provence, to Italy and France.</p>

<p>To the Letters of Serrano rejoinders appeared at once from Clement
Vannetti, the person to whom Serrano had addressed them, and from
Alessandro Zorzi, a friend of Tiraboschi;—and to the Dissertation
of Father Andres, Tiraboschi himself<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_429">[p. 429]</span> replied, with much gentleness, in the
notes to subsequent editions of his “Storia della Letteratura.” (See
Angelo Ant. Scotti, Elogio Storico del Padre Giovanni Andres, Napoli,
1817, 8vo, pp. 13, 143, Tiraboschi, Storia, ed. Roma, 1782, Tom. II. p.
23.)</p>

<p>Meantime, others among the exiled Spanish Jesuits in Italy, such
as Arteaga, who afterwards wrote the valuable “Rivoluzioni del Teatro
Musicale,” 1783, and Father Isla, who had been famous for his “Friar
Gerund” from 1758, took an interest in the controversy. (Salas, Vida
del Padre Isla, Madrid, 1803, 12mo, p. 136.) But the person who brought
to it the learning which now makes it of consequence in Spanish
literary history was Francisco Xavier Lampillas, or Llampillas, who was
born in Catalonia, in 1731, and was, for some time, Professor of Belles
Lettres in Barcelona, but who, from the period of his exile as a Jesuit
in 1767 to that of his death in 1810, lived chiefly in Genoa or its
neighbourhood, devoting himself to literary pursuits, and publishing
occasionally works, both in prose and verse, in the Italian language,
which he wrote with a good degree of purity.</p>

<p>Among these works was his “Saggio Storico-apologetico della
Letteratura Spagnuola,” printed between 1778 and 1781, in six volumes,
octavo, devoted to a formal defence of Spanish literature against
Bettinelli and Tiraboschi;—occasionally, however, noticing the mistakes
of others, who, like Signorelli, had touched on the same subject. In
the separate dissertations of which this somewhat remarkable book
is composed, the author discusses the connection between the Latin
poets of Spain and those of Rome in the period following the death
of Augustus;—he examines the question of the Spanish climate raised
by Tiraboschi, and claims for Spain a culture earlier than that of
Italy, and one as ample and as honorable;—he asserts that Spain was
not indebted to Italy for the revival of letters within her borders
at the end of the Dark Ages, or for the knowledge of the art of
navigation that opened to her the New World; while, on the other hand,
he avers that Italy owed to Spain much of the reform of its theological
and juridical studies, especially in the sixteenth centu<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_430">[p. 430]</span>ry;—and brings his work
to a conclusion, in the seventh and eighth dissertations, with an
historical exhibition of the high claims of Spanish poetry generally,
and with a defence of the Spanish theatre from the days of the Romans
down to his own times.</p>

<p>No doubt, some of these pretensions are quite unfounded, and others
are stated much more strongly than they should be; and no doubt, too,
the general temper of the work is any thing rather than forbearing
and philosophical; but still, many of its defensive points are well
maintained, and many of its incidental notices of Spanish literary
history are interesting, if not important. At any rate, it produced a
good effect on opinion in Italy; and, when added to the works published
there soon afterwards by Arteaga, Clavigero, Eximeno, Andres, and other
exiled Spaniards, it tended to remove many of the prejudices that
existed among the Italians against Spanish literature;—prejudices which
had come down from the days when the Spaniards had occupied so much of
Italy as conquerors, and had thus earned for their nation the lasting
ill-will of its people.</p>

<p>Answers, of course, were not wanting to the work of Lampillas, even
before it was completed; one of which, by Bettinelli, appeared in the
nineteenth volume of the “Diario” of Modena, and another, in 1778, by
Tiraboschi, in a separate pamphlet, which he republished afterwards in
the different editions of his great work. To both, Lampillas put forth
a rejoinder in 1781, not less angry than his original Apology, but,
on the whole, less successful, since he was unable to maintain some
of the positions skilfully selected and attacked by his adversaries,
or to establish many of the facts which they had drawn into question.
Tiraboschi reprinted this rejoinder at the end of his own work, with
a few short notes; the only reply which he thought it necessary to
make.</p>

<p>But in Spain the triumph of Lampillas was open and unquestioned.
His Storia Apologetica was received with distinguished honors by the
Academy of History, and, together with his pamphlet defending it, was
published first in 1782, in six volumes, and then, in 1789, in seven
volumes, translated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_431">[p. 431]</span>
by Doña Maria Josefa Amar y Borbon, an Aragonese lady of some literary
reputation. What, however, was yet more welcome to its author, Charles
the Third, the very king by whose command he had been exiled, gave him
an honorable pension for his defence of the national literature, and
acknowledged the merits of the work by his minister, Count Florida
Blanca, who counted among them not only its learning, but an “urbanity”
which now-a-days we are unable to discover in it. (Sempere, Biblioteca,
Tom. III. p. 165.)</p>

<p>After this, the controversy seems to have died away entirely,
except as it appeared in notes to the great work of Tiraboschi, which
he continued to add to the successive editions till his death, in
1794. The result of the whole—so far as the original question is
concerned—is, that a great deal of bad taste is proved to have existed
in Spain and in Italy, especially from the times of Góngora and Marina,
not without connection and sympathy between the two countries, but that
neither can be held exclusively responsible for its origin or for its
diffusion.</p>

<p class="mt2">The first of the manuscripts referred to is the one
mentioned in Vol. I. pp. 94-99, as a poem on the subject of Joseph,
the son of Jacob,—remarkable on many accounts, and, among the rest,
because, in the only copy of it known to exist,—that in the National
Library, Madrid, MSS. G. g., 4to, 101,—it is written entirely in
the Arabic character, so that, for a long time, it was regarded as
an Arabic manuscript. It has not, I believe, been deemed of a later
date than the end of the fourteenth century. Indeed, its language and
general air would seem to indicate an earlier one; but we should bear
in mind that the Moriscos, to some one of whom this poem is due, did
not make a progress in the language and culture of Spain so rapid as
the Spaniards did, by whom, long before the fall of Granada, large
masses of them were surrounded and kept in subjection. On this account
we may conjecture the poem to have been written as late as the year
1400; but its date is uncertain.</p>

<p class="i2">Jacub estaba aflejido por la tardanza de su fijo,</p>

<p class="i2">Quando los bido benir con tal apellido,</p>
<p class="i0">Luego en aquella ora caio amortesido;</p>
<p class="i0">Quando llegaron a él no le hallaron sentido,</p>

<p class="i0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="i2">Dijo Jahuda a todos sus ermanos,</p>
<p class="i0">“Bolbamos por Jusuf, donde estaba encelado,</p>
<p class="i0">I abremos gualardon de nueso padre onrrado;</p>

<p class="i0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="i2">Dijeron sus ermanos, “Eso no aremos;</p>
<p class="i0">Somos diez ermanos, eso bien sabemos;</p>
<p class="i0">Bamos a nueso padre e todo se lo contaremos,</p>
<p class="i0">Que, contandole aquesto, seremos creederos.”</p>
<p class="i0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="i2">Hasta poco de rato Jacob ubo recordado;</p>
<p class="i0">Dijo, “Que es de mi fijo, que es de mi amado?</p>

<p class="i0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="i2">Echolo en la prision aqui a que se bolbiese,</p>
<p class="i0">E que por aquello a ella obedeciese;</p>
<p class="i0">E entiendolo el Rei ante que muriese</p>
<p class="i0">E juró que non salria mientras que él bibiese.</p>
<p class="i0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="i2">E quando aquesto fue fecho, Zaleja fue repentida;</p>
<p class="i0">No lo abria querido fazer en dias de su vida,</p>
<p class="i0">Diziendo, “O mezquina, nunca seré guarida</p>

<p class="i0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="i2">Alli iaze diez annos como si fuese cordero,</p>
<p class="i0">Daquí á que mandó el Rei á un su portero</p>
<p class="i0">Echar en la prision dos ombres i el tercero,</p>
<p class="i0">El uno su escancieno e el otro un panicero;</p>
<p class="i0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="i2"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_441">[p. 441]</span>Porque abian pensado al Rei de far traicion,</p>
<p class="i0">Que en el bino e en el pan que le echasen ponzon.</p>
<p class="i0">Probado fué al panicero, e al escancieno non,</p>
<p class="i0">Porque mejor supo catar e encobrir la traicion.</p>
<p class="i0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="i2">Allí do estaban presos mui bien los castigaba,</p>
<p class="i0">E qualquiera que enfermaba mui bien lo curaba;</p>
<p class="i0">Todos lo guardaban por do quiera que el estaba,</p>
<p class="i0">Porque el lo merecia, su figura se lo daba.</p>
<p class="i0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="i2">Sonno el escancieno un suenno tan pesado;</p>
<p class="i0">Contolo a Jusuf, i sacosele de grado.</p>
<p class="i0">Dijo, “Tu fues escancieno de tu Sennor onrrado,</p>
<p class="i0">Mas oi en seras a tu oficio tornado,</p>
<p class="i0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="i2">“E abras perdon de tu Sennor;</p>

<p class="i0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="i2">Dijo el panicero al su compannero,</p>
<p class="i0">“Io dire a Jusuf que e sonnado un suenno</p>
<p class="i0">De noche en tal dia, quando salia el lucero,</p>
<p class="i0">I beré que me dize en su seso certero.”</p>
<p class="i0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="i2">Contole el panicero el suenno que queria,</p>
<p class="i0">I sacosele Jusuf é nada no le mentia;</p>
<p class="i0">Dijo, “Tu fues panicero del Rei todabia,</p>
<p class="i0">Mas aqui iaceras porque fiziste falsia;</p>
<p class="i0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="i2">“Que al tercero dia seras tu luego suelto,</p>
<p class="i0">E seras enforcado a tu cabeza el tuerto,</p>
<p class="i0">E comeran tus meollos las abes del puerto;</p>
<p class="i0">Alli seras colgado hasta que sias muerto.”</p>
<p class="i0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="i2">Dijo el panicero, “No sonné cosa certera,</p>
<p class="i0">Que io me lo dezia por ber la manera.”</p>
<p class="i0">Dijo Jusuf, “Esta es cosa berdadera,</p>
<p class="i0">Que lo que tu dijestes, Allah lo embió por carrera.”</p>
<p class="i0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="i2">Dijo Jusuf al escancieno aquesta razon;</p>
<p class="i0">“Ruegote que recuerdes al Rei de mi prision,</p>
<p class="i0">Que arto me a durado esta gran maldicion.”</p>
<p class="i0">Dijo el escancieno, “Plaze me de corazon.”</p>
<p class="i0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="i2">Que al tercero dia salieron de grado,</p>
<p class="i0">E fueron delante del Rei, su Sennor onrrado;</p>
<p class="i0">E mandó el panicero ser luego enforcado,</p>
<p class="i0">Dijo, “El escancieno á su oficio a tornado.”</p>
<p class="i0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="i2">Olbidosele al escancieno de decir el su mandado,</p>
<p class="i0">E no le membro por dos años ni le fué acordado,</p>
<p class="i0">Fasta que sonnó un suenno el Rei apoderado;</p>
<p class="i0">Doce annos estubo preso, e esto mal de su grado.</p>
<p class="i0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="i2">Aqueste fue el suenno que el Rei ubo sonnado,</p>
<p class="i0">De que salia del agua un rio granado,</p>
<p class="i0">Anir era su nombre preciado e granado,</p>
<p class="i0">I bido que en salian siete bacas de grado.</p>

<p class="i0">I bido otras siete magras, flacas, e delgadas.</p>
<p class="i0">Comianse las flacas a las gordas granadas,</p>
<p class="i0">E no se les parecia ni enchian las hilladas.</p>
<p class="i0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="i2">E bido siete espigas mui llenas de grano,</p>
<p class="i0">Berdes e fermosas como en tiempo de berano;</p>
<p class="i0">E bido otras siete secas con grano bano,</p>
<p class="i0">Todas secas e blancas como caballo cano.</p>
<p class="i0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="i2">Comianse las secas a las berdes del dia,</p>
<p class="i0">E no se les parecia ninguna mejoria;</p>
<p class="i0">Tornabanse todas secas cada guna bacia,</p>
<p class="i0">Todas secas e blancas como de niebla fria.</p>
<p class="i0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="i2">El Rei se marabello de como se comian</p>
<p class="i0">Las flacas a las gordas granadas,</p>
<p class="i0">I las siete espigas secas a las berdes mojadas,</p>
<p class="i0">I entendio que en su suenno abia largas palabras,</p>
<p class="i0">E no podia pensar a que fuesen sacadas.</p>
<p class="i0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="i2">E llamo a los sabidores e el suenno les fue a contar,</p>
<p class="i0">Que se lo sacasen e no ge diesen bagar,</p>
<p class="i0">E ellos le dijeron, “Nos querais aquejar,</p>
<p class="i0">Miraremos en los libros o no te daremos bagar.”</p>
<p class="i0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="i2">Dijeronle, “Sennor, no seais aquejado;</p>
<p class="i0">No son los suennos ciertos en tiempo arrebatado.</p>
<p class="i0">Los amores crecen segun noso cuidado,</p>
<p class="i0">Mas a las de beras suelen tornar en falso.”</p>
<p class="i0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="i2">I amansose el Rei, e dioles de mano,</p>
<p class="i0">Porque el entendio que andaban en bano.</p>
<p class="i0">E ubo de saber aquello el escancieno,</p>
<p class="i0">E binose al Rei, e diole la mano.</p>
<p class="i0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="i2">E dijole, “Sennor, io sé un sabidor onrrado</p>
<p class="i0">El qual está en prision firmemente atorteado;</p>
<p class="i0">Dos annos abemos que del non me e acordado,</p>

<p class="i0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="i2">“Ia me saco un suenno, cierto le bi benir.”</p>
<p class="i0">E el Rei le respondio, “Amigo, empieza de ir,</p>
<p class="i0">E contaselo todo, como as oido dezir,</p>
<p class="i0">E librarlo emos mui presto e sacarlo io de alli.”</p>
<p class="i0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="i2">E fuese el escancieno a Jusuf de grado,</p>
<p class="i0">E dijo, “Perdoname, amigo, que olbidé tu mandado,</p>

<p class="i2">“Mas ruegote, ermano, en amor del Criador,</p>
<p class="i0">Que me saques un suenno que bido mi Sennor.”</p>
<p class="i0">La ora dijo Jusuf, “Plazeme de corazon,</p>

<p class="i0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="i2">E contole el suenno todo bien cumplido,</p>

<p class="i0">Quando el suenno fue contado, Jusuf ubo entendido;</p>

<p class="i2">Ninguno sabia del Rei la puridad,</p>
<p class="i0">I embioles a todos de buena boluntad:</p>

<p class="i0">Diciendo, “Guardaos, traidores, que abeis echo falta;</p>
<p class="i0">Mala obra obrastes al Rei todabia.”</p>
<p class="i0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="i2">Quedaronse todos cada guno espantado</p>
<p class="i0">Del dicho que oieron a tan mal airado,</p>
<p class="i0">E dijeron todos, “Aun ganades gran pecado</p>

<p class="i0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="i2">“Decidnos que queredes o que demandades,</p>
<p class="i0">O que os han furtado que ansi bos quejades.”</p>
<p class="i0">E ellos les dijeron, “La mesura bos tomastes,</p>
<p class="i0">La que decia al Rei todas las berdades.</p>
<p class="i0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="i2">“Dela quien la tiene, i albricias le daremos,</p>
<p class="i0">Un cafiz de trigo del mejor que tenemos.”</p>
<p class="i0">I ellos los dijeron, “Por la fe que tenemos,</p>
<p class="i0">No somos malfautores que nos no lo faremos.</p>

<p class="i2">“No benimos de natura de fazer desguisado,</p>
<p class="i0">No lo abemos fecho en el tiempo pasado,</p>

<p class="i0">I ellos le dijeron, “Catebo quede el ladron</p>
<p class="i0">Al uso de la tierra con mui buena razon.”</p>
<p class="i0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="i2">Buscaron los sacos del trigo e cada uno pribado,</p>

<p class="i0">Porque no abian buscado el saco de su ermanillo;</p>
<p class="i0">Dijeron ellos, “Antes bamos al castillo”;</p>
<p class="i0">E ellos mismos le buscaron e fallaron el furtillo.</p>
<p class="i0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="i2"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_454">[p. 454]</span>E de que bieron ellos todos los ermanos</p>
<p class="i0">Que era la mesura, quedaron espantados;</p>

<p class="i0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="i2">Dijo, “Ermanos, ruegoos no bos quejedes;</p>

<p class="i0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="i2">Dijeron, “Sennor, si a furtado no lo aias a marabella,</p>
<p class="i0">Que un ermano tenia de mui mala pelelha;</p>
<p class="i0">Quando era chico furtose una cinta bella,</p>
<p class="i0">Ellos eran de una madre, e nosotros non de aquella.”</p>
<p class="i0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="i2">E sonriose el Rei dentro en su corazon</p>
<p class="i0">De la palabra mala dicha a sin razon;</p>
<p class="i0">Dijoles el Rei, “Io bos dicho la razon,</p>
<p class="i0">Que todos a mi tenedes figuras de ladron.”</p>
<p class="i0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="i2">E mando que lo tomasen e lo llebasen rastrado,</p>

<p class="i0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="i2">E mandolo llebar el Rei a su camara real</p>
<p class="i0">Fasta que sus ermanos fuesen a iantar;</p>
<p class="i0">E quando fueron idos e mandados del lugar,</p>
<p class="i0">El Rei se fue aprisa a su ermano a fablar.</p>
<p class="i0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="i2">E tomaronse los dos luego de mano a mano,</p>
<p class="i0">Disendole el Rei, “Io soi Jusuf tu ermano,</p>
<p class="i0">El que fue perdido de mi padre el cano,</p>
<p class="i0">El qual por mi es triste i io por él no soi sano.”</p>
<p class="i0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="i2">Mandolo adereza el Rei de nobles pannos pribados,</p>

<p class="i0">Disendoles, “Que dize este son certero?”</p>
<p class="i0">I dijeronle ellos, “No lo entendemos a fe, caballero.”</p>

<p class="mt2">There is little, as it seems to me, in the early
narrative poetry of any modern nation better worth reading, than this
old Morisco version of the story of Joseph. Parts of it overflow with
the tenderest natural affection; other parts are deeply pathetic; and
everywhere it bears the impress of the extraordinary state of manners
and society that gave it birth. From several passages, it may be
inferred that it was publicly recited; and even now, as we read it, we
fall unconsciously into a long-drawn chant, and seem to hear the voices
of Arabian camel-drivers, or of Spanish muleteers, as the Oriental or
the romantic tone happens to prevail. I am acquainted with nothing in
the form of the old metrical romance that is more attractive,—nothing
that is so peculiar, original, and separate from every thing else of
the same class.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> next of the Inedita is the “Danza
General,” which I have noticed, (Vol. I. pp. 89-91,) and which is found
in the Library of San Lorenzo del Escorial, MSS., Cas. IV., Let. b, No.
21. In note 27 on the passage referred to I have suggested a reason for
conjecturing that the Spanish poem may be taken from an earlier French
one; but I ought to add, that, so far as I am aware, this ghastly
fiction is not known to exist in any earlier form, than that in which
it appears in this Manuscript.</p>

  <h4>No. III.</h4>
  <p class="subh3 centra"><big>EL LIBRO DEL RABI SANTOB.</big></p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> poetry of the Rabbi de Santob, whose
name and title are spelt in different ways, is here printed from the
manuscript in the National Library at Madrid, marked B. b. 82, folio,
beginning at f. lxi. I have spoken of it, (Vol. I. pp. 86, 87,) and
would repeat the wish there expressed, that the present copy should be
collated with the one in the Library of the Escurial.</p>


<p class="fs90 mt2">Como quiera que dize Salomon, e dize verdat, en
el libro de los proverbios, “quien acrecienta ciencia, acrescienta
dolor,” pero que yo entiendo que a esto que el llama dolor que es
trabajo del coraçon e del entendimiento. E asi no lo devemos tener
al tal dolor por malo, ca el non lo dixo mal dolor, nin por que ome
deue causa escusarse de la ciencia e de la buena arte en la ciencia
es causa al entendido, poned le en folgura corporal e espiritual, e
aun digo que Salomon antes cual e despues que escrivio e dixo en los
dicho proverbios e el que acreçienta çiençia acresçienta dolor al
acresçento ciencia amos del ade oy vista en la biblia que le e ... el
dicho libro de proverbios e el libro de los cantares o canticores e el
libro de vanidades o clesiasticas, e fiso el libro de sapiençia, amad
justiçia los que judgades la tierra, e sea asy que se entiende que no
lo dixo por mal dolor, casy lo el syntiera por dolor no se trabajara de
acresçentar çiençia, pero este dolor es asemejado al trabajo de bien
faser, que trabaja ome en yr luengo camino por alcançar conplimiento de
su deseo, e es aquel trabajo folgura, gloria, e no dolor, aunque pasa
por el por lo mucho del bien fase ninguno aquelo dolor, e asi que dixo,
acreçienta dolor, por que quien mucho lee mucho trabaja, e mientra mas
acresçienta el estudio mas acrescienta trabajo para el fruto que el
entendides ssaca del tal trabajo para el fruto o dolor es de tamaña
gloria que el trabajo e dolor con que se alcanço es ninguno e cosa
olvidada e non sentyda, non enpecible mas antes fue, e es causa de bien
e es afigurado, como sy disen a omen contar doblas para el ciento es
que trabaja en el contar, pero mas pro saca myentra mas contare asi que
non lo dixo por dolor es pecible ni malo, ca dolor ay que ome desea á
las veses que con el avrie grant folgura e non syn el asi que es muchas
veses deseado dolor et commo la tanger mañera que todavia cobdiçia
aquel dolor mas que todas las folguras e viçios del mundo porque es
causa de todo su deseo asi que es dolor nesçesario o provechoso, e por
esto non deve çesar de fablar çiençia el que sabe por cuyta de sofrir
trabajos o dolor, mayor mente que es notorio, que vyene por devyna
influyda de Dios en el omen que la asi que non la da Dios para que la
calle nin para quel influydo solo salvo para faser bien commo la sacra
ley que dio a Muyssen non sollamente para el<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_476">[p. 476]</span> mas para ssu pueblo de generaçion e aun
para todos los nasçidos que a su ley sse allegaron, como dise Ysayas en
el cº.</p>

<p class="fs90">El linaje que lo serviere sera contado a el por publico
suyo asi que el sseñor da sabiduria a uno para enseñarla a muchos, e
puede aqui desir que qvien quisyere pues el señor Dios commo da la
sabiduria a uno para enseñarla a muchos, tan bien la podria dar á los
muchos e en verdat para que o porque es esto diria yo a el respondote
que tan bien podria dar Dios la ley syn que se enseñase por escritura a
cada nasçido pero no se le entendia ni seria sabido que bynya de Dios,
nin por acarreamiento del Espiritu Sancto asy que non seria Dios tan
conoscido, e por esto es en el secreto de Dios vien lo que a nos non se
entyende, ca el Señor todas las cosas que el fiso e son con sabiduria
acabada que es en el asi que devemos creer que es bien aprender que
quien pretende e entender del que entyende e punar en el tal trabajo
que naçe dello gloria e folgura asi que non es dolor doloroso, mas es
dolor provechoso. Pues asi es, plaziendo a Dios, declarare algo en las
trobas de Rabisantob el Judio de Carrion en algunas partes que parescen
escritas aunque no son escritas salvo por quanto son trobas e todas
escritura rymada paresçe entrepatada e non lo es que por guardar los
consonantes disce algunas veses lo que ha de desir despues disce lo
antes. E esto quiero yo trabajar en declarar con el ayuda de Dios para
algunos que pueden ser que leeran e non entenderan syn que otro gelas
declare commo algunas veses la he ya visto esto por cuanto syn dubda
las dichas trobas son muy notable escritura, que todo omen la deviera
de curar, ca esta fue la entençion del sabio Raby que las fiso, por que
escritura rimada es mejor decorada que non la que va por testo llano,
e dise asy el prologo de sus rymas es veynte e tres coplas fasta de
quiero desir del mundo.</p>

<p class="mt2">In all three of the inedited poems contained in this
Appendix, and especially in that of the Rabbi Santob, are mistakes
and false readings, that have arisen directly from the imperfections
of the original manuscripts. Many of them are obvious, and could have
been corrected easily; but it has not seemed to me that a foreigner
should venture into a field so peculiarly national. I have confined
myself, therefore, to such a punctuation of each poem as would make
it more readily intelligible,—leaving all further emendations, and
all conjectural criticism and illustration, to the native scholars
of Spain. To them, and to the loyal patriotism for which<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_503">[p. 503]</span> they have always been
distinguished, I earnestly commend the agreeable duty of editing,
not only what is here published for the first time, but the “Rhymed
Chronicle of Fernan Gonzalez,” the “Rimado de Palacio” of the great
Chancellor Ayala, the “Aviso para Cuerdos” of Diego Lopez de Haro,
the works of Juan Alvarez Gato, and other similar monuments of their
early literature, of which I have already spoken, but which, existing
sometimes, like the “Poema de José,” only in a single manuscript, and
rarely in more than two or three, may easily be lost for ever by any
one of the many accidents that constantly endanger the existence of all
such literary treasures.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_1"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_1">[1]</a></span> All these satires are found in the
works of their respective authors, heretofore cited, except that of
Morillo “On the Corrupted Manners of his Times,” which is in Espinosa,
Flores, 1605, f. 119. The “Epístolas” of Artieda were printed the same
year, under the name of “Artemidoro,” and are six in number. The best
are one against the life of a sportsman, and one in ironical defence
of the follies of society. A letter of Virues to his brother, also
dated 1605, might have been added. It is a pleasant satirical account
of a military march from Milan to the Low Countries, passing the St.
Gothard.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_2"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_2">[2]</a></span> They were first printed in Sedano,
Parnaso, Tom. IX., 1778.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_3"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_3">[3]</a></span> Rimas, 1618, p. 198. It is a
remarkably happy union of the Italian form of verse and the Roman
spirit.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_4"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_4">[4]</a></span> Rimas, 1634, pp. 56, 234, 254. It is
singular, however, that, while Bartolomé imitates Horace, he expresses
his preference for Juvenal.</p>

<div class="poem mt1"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">Pero quando á escribir sátiras llegues,</p>
<p class="i0">A ningun irritado cartapacio,</p>
<p class="i0">Sino al del cauto Juvenal, te entregues.</p>
</div></div>

<p class="mt1">He seems, too, to have been accounted an imitator of
Juvenal by his contemporaries; for Guevara, in his “Diablo Cojuelo,”
Tranco IX., calls him “Divino Juvenal Aragones.” But it is impossible
not to see that he is full of Horatian turns of thought.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_5"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_5">[5]</a></span> It is the last poem in the
“Melpomene.”</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_6"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_6">[6]</a></span> The satires of all these authors are
in their collected works, except those of Villegas, which were printed
from manuscripts, supposed to be the originals, by Sedano (Tom. IX. pp.
3-18); or rather, two of them on bad poets were so printed, for the
third seems to have been suppressed, on account of its indelicacy.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_7"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_7">[7]</a></span> Cervantes is a strong case in point.
In the fourth chapter of his “Journey to Parnassus,” immediately
after speaking of his Don Quixote, he disavows having ever written
any thing satirical, and denounces <i>all</i> such compositions as low and
base. Indeed, the very words <i>sátira</i> and <i>satírico</i> came at last to
be used in a bad sense oftener than in a good one. Huerta, Sinónimos
Castellanos, Valencia, 1807, 2 tom. 12mo, <i>ad verb.</i></p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_8"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_8">[8]</a></span> A striking instance of this is to be
found in the “Primera Parle del Parnaso Antártico,” by Diego Mexia,
printed at Seville, 1608, 4to, and the only portion of it ever printed.
It consists of an original poetical letter by a lady to Mexia, and a
translation of twenty-one of the Epistles of Ovid and his “Ibis”; all
in <i>terza rima</i>, and nearly all in pure and beautiful Castilian verse.
In the edition in the collection of Fernandez, Tom. XIX., 1799, the
epistle by the lady is omitted, which is a pity, since it contains
notices of several South American poets.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_9"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_9">[9]</a></span> The best elegiac poetry in the
Spanish language is, perhaps, that in the two divisions of the first
eclogue of Garcilasso. Elegies, or mournful poems of any kind, are
often called <i>Endechas</i> in Spanish, as Quevedo called his sad amatory
poems; but the origin of the word is not settled, nor its meaning quite
well defined. Venegas, in a vocabulary of obscure words at the end of
his “Agonía del Tránsito de la Muerte,” 1574, p. 370, says he thinks it
comes from <i>inde jaces</i>, as if the mourner addressed the dead body. But
this is absurd. It may come from the Greek ἕνδεκα, for when the last
verse of each stanza contained just eleven syllables, the poem was said
to be written in <i>endechas reales</i>. See Covarrubias, and the Academy,
<i>ad verbum</i>, who give no opinion.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_10"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_10">[10]</a></span> There are many editions of the
Works of Saa de Miranda; but the second and best (s. l. 1614, 4to)
is preceded by a life of him, which claims to have been composed by
his personal friends, and which states the odd fact, that the lady of
whom he was enamoured was so ugly, that her family declined the match
until he had well considered the matter; but that he persevered, and
became so fondly attached to her, that he died, at last, from grief at
her loss. His merits as a poet are well discussed by Ant. das Neves
Pereira, in the fifth volume of the “Memorias de Litt. Portugueza” of
the Royal Academy of Sciences, Lisboa, 1793, pp. 99, etc. Some of his
works are in the Spanish Index Expurgatorius, 1667, p. 72.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_11"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_11">[11]</a></span> Of the poets whose eclogues are
found in their prose pastorals I shall speak at large when I examine
this division of Spanish romantic fiction. Montemayor, however,
it should be noted here, wrote other eclogues, which are in his
Cancionero, 1588, ff. 111, etc.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_12"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_12">[12]</a></span> It is found in the important
collection, the “Flores,” of Espinosa, f. 66, where it first
appeared.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_13"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_13">[13]</a></span> “Eglogas Pastoriles de Pedro de
Padilla,” Sevilla, 1582, 4to; thirteen in number, in all measures, and
the last one partly in prose. Of Padilla, who was much connected with
the men of letters of his time, all needful notices may be found in
Navarrete, “Vida de Cervantes,” pp. 396-402, and in Clemencin’s Notes
to Don Quixote, Tom. I. p. 147. The curate well says of his “Tesoro de
Poesías,” (Madrid, 1587, 12mo,) “They would be better, if they were
fewer.” They fill above nine hundred pages, and are in all forms and
styles. Padilla died as late as 1599.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_14"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_14">[14]</a></span> There are six of them, in
<i>terza</i> and <i>ottava rima</i>, with a few lyrical poems interspersed, in
other measures and in a better tone, in a volume entitled “Versos
Espirituales,” Cuenca, 1596, 12mo. Their author was a monk.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_15"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_15">[15]</a></span> The eclogue of Morales is in
Espinosa, f. 48, and that of Tapia occurs—where we should hardly look

are found in their respective works, already examined; but of Francisco
de Castilla and of Juan de Mendoza and their poetry it may be proper to
give some notice, as their names have not occurred before.</p>

<p class="ti1">Castilla was a gentleman apparently of the old national
type, descended from an illegitimate branch of the family of Pedro el
Cruel. He lived in the time of Charles V., and passed his youth near
the person of that great sovereign; but, as he says in a letter to
his brother, the Bishop of Calahorra, he at last “withdrew himself,
disgusted alike with the abhorred rabble and senseless life of the
court,” and “chose the estate of matrimony, as one more safe for his
soul and better suited to his worldly condition.” How he fared in
this experiment he does not tell us; but, missing, in the retirement
it brought with it, those pleasures of social intercourse to which
he had been accustomed, he bought, as he says, “with a small sum of
money, other surer and wiser friends,” whose counsels and teachings he
put into verse, that his weak memory might the better preserve them.
The result of this life merely contemplative was a book, in which he
gives us, first, his “Theórica de Virtudes,” or an explanation, in
the old short Spanish verse, accompanied with a prose gloss, of the
different Virtues, ending with the vengeful Nemesis; next, a Treatise
on Friendship, in long nine-line stanzas; and then, successively, a
Satire on Human Life and its vain comforts; an Allegory on Worldly
Happiness; a series of Exhortations to Virtue and Holiness, which he
has unsuitably called Proverbs; and a short discussion, in <i>décimas</i>,
on the Immaculate Conception. At the end, separately paged, as if it
were quite a distinct treatise, we have a counterpart to the “Theórica
de Virtudes,” called the “Prática de las Virtudes de los Buenos Reyes
de España”; a poem in above two hundred octave stanzas, on the Virtues
of the Kings of Spain, beginning with Alaric the Goth and ending with
the Emperor Charles V., to whom he dedicates it with abundance of
courtly flattery. The whole volume, both in the prose and verse, is
written in the strong old Castilian style, sometimes encumbered with
learning, but oftener rich, pithy, and flowing. The following stanza,
written, apparently, when its author was already disgusted with his
court life, but had not given it up, may serve as a specimen of his
best manner:—</p>

<p class="mt1">An edition of Castilla’s very rare volume may have been
printed about 1536, when it was licensed; but I have never seen it,
nor any notice of it. The one of which I have a copy was printed at
Zaragoza, 4to, lit. got., 1552; and I believe there is one of Alcalá,
either in 1554 or 1564, 8vo.</p>

<p class="ti1">The poetry of Juan Hurtado de Mendoza, who was Regidor
of Madrid, and a member of the Cortes of 1544, is, perhaps, more rare
than that of Castilla, and is contained in a small volume printed at
Alcalá in 1550, and entitled “Buen Placer trovado en treze discantes de
quarta rima Castellana segun imitacion de trobas Francesas,” etc. It
consists of thirteen discourses on a happy life, its means and motives,
all written in stanzas of four lines each, which their author calls
<i>French</i>, I suppose, because they are longer lines than those in the
old national measures, and rhymed alternately,—the rhymes of one stanza
running into the next. At the end is a <i>Canto Real</i>, as it is called,
on a verse in the Psalms, composed in the same manner; and several
smaller poems, one of which is a kind of religious <i>villancico</i>, and
four of them sonnets. The tone of the whole is didactic, and its
poetical value small. I cite eight lines, as a specimen of its peculiar
manner and rhymes:—</p>

<div class="poem mt1"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">Errado va quien busca ser contento</p>
<p class="i2">En mal plazer mortal, que como heno</p>
<p class="i2">Se seca y passa como humo en viento,</p>
<p class="i2">De vanos tragos de ayre muy relleno.</p>
<p class="i0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="i0">Quando las negras velas van en lleno</p>
<p class="i2">Del mal plazer, villano peligroso,</p>
<p class="i2">De buen principio y de buen fin ageno,</p>
<p class="i2">No halla en esta vida su reposo.</p>

<p class="mt1">Mendoza was a person of much consideration in his time,
and is noticed as such by Quintana, (Historia de Madrid, Madrid, 1629,
folio,) who gives one of his sonnets at f. 27, and a sketch of his
character at f. 245.</p>

de Guzman” (Sevilla, 1581, 12mo) are imitations of Petrarca’s
“Trionfi,” but are much more didactic, giving, for instance, under
the head of “The Triumph of Wisdom,” the opinions of the wise men of
antiquity; and under the head of “The Triumph of Prudence,” the general
rules for prudent conduct.</p>

the first thing published in the “Parnaso Español” of Sedano, 1768, and
was vehemently attacked by Yriarte, when, in 1777, he printed his own
translation of the same work. (Obras de Yriarte, Madrid, 1805, 12mo,
Tom. IV.) To this Sedano replied in the ninth volume of his “Parnaso,”
1778. Yriarte rejoined in a satirical dialogue, “Donde las dan las
toman” (Obras, Tom. VI.); and Sedano closed the controversy with the
“Coloquios de Espina,” Malaga, 1785, 2 tom. 12mo, under the name of
Juan María Chavero y Eslava. It is a very pretty literary quarrel,
quite in the Spanish manner.</p>

the “Inventores de las Cosas,” taken generally from Polydore Virgil,
and dated 1608, was first published in the ninth volume of the same
collection, 1778. How absurd the last is may be inferred from the fact,
that it makes Moses the inventor of hexameter verse, and Alexander the
Great the oldest of paper-makers.</p>

is to be found in the eighteenth volume of Fernandez’s collection. His
life is well set forth in the excellent “Diccionario de los Profesores
de las Bellas Artes, por A. Cean Bermudez,” Madrid, 1800, 6 tom. 12mo,
Tom. I. p. 316; besides which, its learned author, at the end of Tom.
V., has republished the fragments of the poem on Painting in a better
order than that in which they had before appeared; adding a pleasant
prose discourse, in a pure style, on Ancient and Modern Painting and
Sculpture, which Céspedes wrote in 1604, when recovering from a fever,
and two other of his trifles; to the whole of which is prefixed a
judicious Preface by Cean himself. Céspedes had been a Greek scholar
in his youth, and says, that, in his old age, when he chanced to open
Pindar, he “never failed to find a well-drawn and rich picture, grand
and fit for Michel Angelo to paint.” He was a friend of Carranza, the
great archbishop, who, after being a leading member of the Council
of Trent, and confessor of Mary of England after she married Philip
II., was worried to death by the Inquisition in 1576. (See, <i>ante</i>,
Vol. I. p. 466.) Céspedes himself came near suffering from a similar
persecution, in consequence of a letter he wrote to Carranza in 1559,
in which he spoke disrespectfully of the Grand Inquisitor and the Holy
Office. Llorente, Hist., Tom. II. p. 440.</p>

reprinted, Madrid, 1789, 8vo. The words <i>Germanía</i>, <i>Germano</i>, etc.,
were applied to the jargon in which the rogues talked with one another.
Hidalgo, who wrote only six of the ballads he published, gives at the
end of his collection a vocabulary of this dialect, which is recognized
as genuine by Mayans y Siscar, and reprinted in his “Orígenes”; so that
the suggestion of Clemencin, which I have followed in the text, where
I speak of Juan Hidalgo as a pseudonyme, may not be well founded;—a
suggestion further discountenanced by the fact, that, in Tom. XXXVIII.
of the Comedias Escogidas, 1672, the play of “Los Mozárabes de Toledo”
is attributed to a Juan Hidalgo. That this had nothing to do with the
Gypsies, though supposed, in the last edition, to have been connected
with them, is shown in Borrow’s “Zincali,” London, 1841, 8vo, Tom. II.

into the popular ballad-books, if, indeed, some of the best of them
were not, as I suspect, originally written for the “Flor de Romances”
of Villalta, printed at Valencia in 1593, 18mo.</p>

to prove the universal prevalence of ballads in the seventeenth
century; for the literature of that century often reads like a mere
monument of it. But if I wished to name any thing, it would be the Don
Quixote, where Sancho is made to cite them so often; and the Novelas
of Cervantes, especially “The Little Gypsy,” who sings her ballads in
the houses of the nobles and the church of Santa María; and “Rinconete
and Cortadillo,” where they make the coarse merriment of the thieves of
Seville. Indeed, as the puppet-showman says, in Don Quixote, (Parte II.
c. 26,) “They were in the mouths of every body,—of the very boys in the
streets.”</p>

4to, 112 leaves, well printed at Valencia, in 1542, without the name of

The Diana of Montemayor was so popular, that at least sixteen editions
of the original appeared in eighty years; six French translations,
according to Gordon de Percel (Bib. de l’Usage des Romans, Paris,
1734, 12mo, Tom. II. pp. 23, 24); two German, according to Ebert; and
one English. The last, by Bartholomew Yong, (London, 1598, folio,) is
excellent, and some of its happy versions of the poetry of Montemayor
are found in “England’s Helicon,” 1600 and 1614, reprinted in the third
volume of the “British Bibliographer,” London, 1810, 8vo. The story
of Proteus and Julia, in “The Two Gentlemen of Verona,” was supposed
by Mrs. Lenox and Dr. Farmer to be taken from that of Felismena, in
the second book of Montemayor’s Diana, and therefore Collier has
republished Yong’s translation of the last in the second volume of his
“Shakspeare’s Library,” (London, s. a. 8vo,) though he doubts whether
Shakspeare were really indebted to it. Malone’s Shakspeare, Boswell’s

Diana is that with a life of him by Cerdá, Madrid, 1802, 12mo;
particularly valuable for the notes to the “Canto de Turia,” in which,
imitating the “Canto de Orfeo,” where Montemayor gives an account of
the famous <i>ladies</i> of his time, Polo gives an account of the famous
<i>poets</i> of Valencia. For lives of Polo see, also, Ximeno, Escritores
de Valencia, Tom. I. p. 270, and Fuster, Bib. Valentina, Tom. I. p.

poems.</p>

ridicules in the sixth chapter of the first part of Don Quixote, and
in the third chapter of his “Journey to Parnassus”; and is curious for
some specimens of Sardinian poetry which it contains. But Pedro de
Pineda, a teacher of Spanish in London, taking the irony of the good
curate in Don Quixote on Lo Frasso’s romance to be sincere praise,
printed a new edition of it, in two very handsome volumes, (London,
1740, 8vo,) with a foolish Dedication and Prólogo, alleging the
authority of Cervantes for its great merit. Hardly any other of the
Spanish prose pastorals is so absurd as this, or contains so much bad
verse; a great deal of which is addressed to living and known persons
by their titles. The tenth book, indeed, is almost entirely made up
of such poetry. I do not recollect that Cervantes is so severe on any
poet, in his “Journey to Parnassus,” as he is on Lo Frasso.</p>

much praise. Ginguené complains of the original, which extends to seven
thousand lines, for being too long. It is so; but this translation of
Doña Isabel is much longer, containing, I think, above eleven thousand
lines. Its worst fault, however, is its bad taste. There is a drama
with the same title, “El Pastor Fido,” in the Comedias Escogidas, Tom.
VIII., 1657, f. 106;—but, though it is said to be written by three

gives us a letter, dated at Seville, April 20th, 1607, from Aleman to
Cervantes, of whose origin or discovery we receive no account whatever,
and into which its author seems to have thrust all the proverbs and
allusions he could collect;—none, however, so obscure that the curious
learning of Don Adolfo cannot elucidate them. The whole letter is a
complaint of Aleman’s own hard fortune, and a prediction of that of
Cervantes, ending with a declaration of the purpose of its writer to go
to Mexico. It does not seem to me to be genuine; but if it is, it gives
the <i>coup de grace</i> to Clemencin’s conjectures, in his notes to both

1846, 8vo, in the third volume of the “Biblioteca” of Aribau.
Previously, it had been hardly known in literary history, and much
overlooked by the bibliographers; Ebert, who had found some traces of
it, attributing it to Aleman himself, and considering it as a true
second part of the Guzman. But this is a mistake. Both Aleman himself
and his friend Valdes are explicit on the subject, in their epistles
prefixed to the first edition of the second part;—Valdes declaring
that the author of the continuation in question was “a Valencian, who,
falsifying his own name, called himself Mateo Luxan, to assimilate
himself to Mateo Aleman.” Aleman himself says he was obliged to rewrite
his second part, because he had, through a prodigal communication of
his papers, been robbed and defrauded of the materials out of which
he had originally composed it. The work of the Valencian was printed
at Barcelona in 1603, at Brussels, 1604, etc. On the title-page to
the first edition of the genuine second part Aleman says, “Let the
reader take notice, that the second part published before this is
none of mine, and that this is the only one I recognize.” Fuster, in
his “Biblioteca,” Tom. I. p. 198, gives strong reasons for supposing
the spurious second part was written by Juan Marti, a Valencian
advocate.</p>

the time of the first appearance of these two second parts; one having
sometimes been mistaken for the other. But Fuster evidently believed in
no edition of the <i>spurious</i> second part older than 1603, the license
to which is dated in 1602; and I possess the edition of the <i>genuine</i>
second part, printed at Valencia in 1605, with a license of the same
year, recognizing no earlier publication, and bearing all the usual
proofs of being the first. Both of the second parts promise a third,

fourth being printed at London, 1656, folio; besides which there has
been a subsequent translation by several hands, taken, however, I
think, from the French of Le Sage. The Latin translation was by Gaspar
Ens, and I have seen editions of it referred to as of 1623, 1624, and
1652. Every thing, indeed, shows that the popular success of the Guzman

1735, 4to, edited by Mayans y Siscar, who, in a prefatory notice,
makes the reproach against its author, as the oldest corrupter of the
Spanish prose style, alluded to in the text. There is a good deal of
poetry scattered through the volume; all very conceited and poor.
Some of it is in that sort of verses from which the final syllable is
cut off,—such verses, I mean, as Cervantes has prefixed to the first
part of Don Quixote; and as both that part and the “Pícara Justina”
were originally published in the same year, 1605, some question has
arisen with Pellicer and Clemencin, who is the inventor of these poor,
truncated verses. <i>Le jeu ne vaut pas la chandelle.</i> But, as the first
part of Don Quixote, according to the <i>Tassa</i> prefixed to it, was
struck off as early as the 20th of December, 1604, though the full
copyright was not granted till the 9th of February following, there can

<p id="Footnote_112"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_112">[112]</a></span> “Marcos de Obregon” has been
occasionally a good deal discussed, both by those who have read it and
those who have not, from the use Le Sage has been supposed to have made
of it in the composition of Gil Blas. The charge was first announced
by Voltaire, who had personal reasons to dislike Le Sage, and who, in
his “Siècle de Louis XIV.,” (1752,) said, boldly enough, that “The Gil
Blas is taken entirely from the Spanish romance entitled ‘La Vidad de
lo Escudiero Dom Marcos d’Obrego.’” (Œuvres, ed. Beaumarchais, Paris,
1785, 8vo, Tom. XX. p. 155.) This is one of the remarks Voltaire
sometimes hazarded, with little knowledge of the matter he was
discussing, and it is not true. That Le Sage had seen the “Marcos de
Obregon” there can be no doubt; and none that he made some use of it
in the composition of the Gil Blas. This is apparent at once by the
story which constitutes its Preface, and which is taken from a similar
story in the Prólogo to the Spanish romance; and it is no less plain
frequently afterwards, in the body of the work, where the trick played
on the vanity of Gil Blas, as he is going to Salamanca, (Lib. I. c.
2,) is substantially the same with that played on Marcos, (Relacion
I. Desc. 9,)—where the stories of Camilla (Gil Blas, Liv. I. c. 16,
Marcos, Rel. III. Desc. 8) and of Mergellina (Gil Blas, Liv. II. c. 7,
Marcos, Rel. I. Desc. 3), with many other matters of less consequence,
correspond in a manner not to be mistaken. But this was the way with
Le Sage, who has used Estevanillo Gonzalez, Guevara, Roxas, Antonio de
Mendoza, and others, with no more ceremony. He seemed, too, to care
very little about concealment, for one of the personages in his Gil
Blas is called Marcos de Obregon. But the idea that the Gil Blas was
<i>taken entirely</i> from the Marcos de Obregon of Espinel, or was very
seriously indebted to that work, is absurd. See the next Period, Chap.
IV., note on Father Isla.</p>

<p id="Footnote_113"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_113">[113]</a></span> The name of this author is one
of the many that occur in Spanish literature and history, where it is
difficult to determine which part of it should be used to designate its
owner. The whole of it is Gerónymo de Alcalá Yañez y Rivera; and, no
doubt, his personal acquaintances knew him as “the Doctor Gerónymo.”
In the Index to Antonio’s Bib. Nova, he is placed under <i>Alcalá</i>; but
as that name only implied, I presume, that he had studied in Alcalá, I
have preferred to call him Yañez y Rivera, the first being his father’s
name and the second his mother’s; and I mention the circumstance only
because it is a difficulty which occurs in many cases of the same
sort, and should be noticed once for all. The title of his romance is
“Alonso Moço de Muchos Amos,” and the first part was first printed at
Madrid, in 1624; but my copy is of the edition of Barcelona, 1625,
12mo, showing that it was well regarded in its time, and soon came to
a second edition. Many editions have been published since; sometimes,
like that of Madrid, 1804, 2 tom. 12mo, with the title of “El Donado
Hablador,” or The Talkative Lay-Brother, that being the character in
which the hero tells his story. Yañez y Rivera was born in 1563.</p>

at one time in the service of Pedro Faxardo, the Marquis of Velez, who
was Captain-general of Valencia. There is an edition of the “Niña de
los Embustes” as early as 1632, and one of the “Garduña de Sevilla” in
1634. But, except the few hints concerning their author to be gathered
from the titles and prefaces to his stories, and the meagre notices in
Lope de Vega’s “Laurel de Apolo,” Silva VIII., and Antonio, Bib. Nova,

Portuguese by descent, who was educated in Castile, and lived much in
France, where several of his works were first printed. The earliest
edition of the “Siglo Pitagórico” is dated Rouen, 1644, but the one
I use is of Brussels, 1727, in 4to. There is a notice of the life of
Gomez in Barbosa, Tom. I. p. 297, and an examination of his works in
Amador de los Rios, “Judios de España,” 1848, pp. 569, etc. He was of
a Jewish Portuguese family, and Barbosa says he was born in Portugal,
but Amador de los Rios says he was born in Segovia. That he renounced
the Christian religion, which his father had adopted, that he fled to
France in 1638, and that he was burnt in effigy by the Inquisition in
1660, are facts not doubted. His Spanish name was Enriquez de Paz;
and in the Preface to his “Sanson Nazareno” he gives a list of his
published works.</p>

persons in all conditions on earth, doing mischief wherever he goes.
Each chapter of the eighteen into which it is divided is followed by
a moralizing illustration; as, for instance, (c. 5,) the disturbance
Momus excites on earth against heaven is illustrated by the heresies of
Germany and England, in which the Duke of Saxony and Henry VIII. appear

honorably noticed in Pulgar’s “Claros Varones,” Título XVII., and who
is said to have been the ancestor of Narvaez, the minister of state to
Isabella II., is found in Argote de Molina (Nobleza, 1588, f. 296);
in Conde (Historia, Tom. III. p. 262); in Villegas (Inventario, 1565,
f. 94); in Padilla (Romancero, 1583, ff. 117-127); in Lope de Vega
(Remedio de la Desdicha; Comedias, Tom. XIII., 1620); in Don Quixote
(Parte I. c. 5), etc. I think, too, that it may have been given by
Timoneda, under the title of “Historia del Enamorado Moro Abindarraez,”
<i>sine anno</i>, (Fuster, Bib., Tom. I. p. 162,) and it is certainly
among the ballads in his “Rosa Española,” 1573. (See Wolf’s reprint,
1846, p. 107.) It is the subject, also, of a long poem by Francisco
Balbi de Corregio, 1593. (Depping’s Romancero, Leipsique, 1844, 12mo,
Tom. II. p. 231.) That Montemayor took his version of the story of
Narvaez from Villegas nobody will doubt who compares both together and
remembers that it does not appear in the first edition of the “Diana”;
that it is wholly unsuited to its place in such a romance; and that
the difference between the two is only that the story, as told by
Montemayor, in the “Diana,” Book IV., though it is often, for several
sentences together, in the same words with the story in Villegas, is
made a good deal longer by mere verbiage. See, <i>ante</i>, Chap. XXXIII.,

<p class="ti1">In the “Nobiliario” of Ferant de Mexia, (Sevilla, 1492,

full of the feudal spirit of an age that believed in the inherent
qualities of noble blood,—its author (Lib. II. c. 15) boasts that
Narvaez was the brother of his grandfather, calling him “cavallero
de los bienaventurados que ovo en nuestros tiempos desde el Cid acá
batalloso é victorioso.”</p>

530. The “Sobremesa y Alivio de Caminantes,” by Timoneda, printed in
1569, and probably earlier, is merely a collection of a hundred and
sixty-one anecdotes and jests, in the manner of Joe Miller, though
sometimes cited as a collection of tales. They are preceded by twelve
similar anecdotes, by a person who is called Juan Aragones. In all the
editions of the “Patrañuelo,” I believe, except the first and that in
Aribau’s Biblioteca, there are only twenty-one tales;—the eighth, which

<p id="Footnote_141"><span class="label"><a

with that in Shakspeare’s “Pericles,”—was, as we have seen, (Vol. I.
p. 24,) known in Spanish poetry very early, though the old poetical
version of it was not printed till 1844; but it is more likely to have
been taken by Timoneda from the “Gesta Romanorum,” Tale 153, in the
edition of 1488. The story of Griselda he, no doubt, took from the
version of it with which the “Decamerone” ends, though he may have
obtained it elsewhere. (Manni, Istoria del Decamerone, Firenze, 1742,
4to, p. 603.) As to the story so familiar to us in Percy’s “Reliques,”
he probably obtained it from the fourth Novella of Sacchetti, written
about 1370; beyond which I think it cannot be traced, though it has
been common enough ever since, down to Bürger’s version of it. Similar
inquiries would no doubt lead to similar results about other tales in
the “Patrañuelo”; but these instances are enough to show that Timoneda
took any thing he found suited to his purpose, just as the Italian
<i>Novellieri</i> and the French <i>Trouveurs</i> had done before him, without
inquiring or caring whence it came.</p>

small volume entitled “Historia de los Siete Sabios de Roma, compuesta
por Marcos Perez, Barcelona por Rafael Figuero,” 12mo,—no date; but, I
think, printed in the eighteenth century. It contains the story of “The
Seven Wise Masters,” which is one of the oldest of modern fictions,—the
Emperor, in this version of it, being named Ponciano, and being called
the son of Diocletian. The style is somewhat better than that of the

books printed at that time in France, from the connection of the French

“a little remnant of Lope de Vega,” and says his “Para Todos” is “like
the coach from Alcalá to Madrid, full of all sorts of passengers,
including the worst.” (Obras, Tom. XI. p. 129.) Quevedo does not appear
among those who in 1639 offered verses or other tributes to the memory
of Montalvan, though their number is above a hundred and fifty, and
includes, I think, nearly or quite every other Spanish author of any
note then living. See “Lágrimas Panegyricas en la Muerte de Montalvan,”

of Peralta, and know it only from its title in catalogues. Two other
similar works, of a later date, may be added to these. The first is
“El Entretenido,” by Antonio Sanchez Tortoles, which was licensed to
be printed in 1671, but of which I have seen no edition except that
of Madrid, 1729, 4to. It contains the amusements of an academy during
the Christmas holidays; namely, a play, <i>entremes</i>, and poems, with
discussions on subjects of natural history, learning, and theology.
But it contains no tales, and goes through only ten of the fourteen
evenings whose entertainments it announces. The remaining four were
filled up by Joseph Moraleja, (Madrid, 1741, 4to,) with materials
generally more light and gay, and, in one instance, with a tale.
The other work referred to is “Gustos y Disgustos del Lentiscar de
Cartagena, por el Licenciado Gines Campillo de Bayle” (Valencia, 1689,
4to). It takes its name from the “Lentiscar,” a spot near Carthagena
where the Lentisco or mastich-tree abounds; and it consists of twelve
days’ entertainment, given at a country-house to a young lady who
hesitated about taking the veil, but, finding her mistake from the
unhappy ending of each of these days of pleasure, returns gladly to
her convent and completes her profession. Neither of these works is
worth the trouble of reading. The four “Academias” of Jacinto Polo, the
amusements of four days of a wedding, (Obras, 1670, pp. 1-106,) are
better, but consist chiefly of poems.</p>

opens with “An Abridgment of the Excellences of Spain,” and each of the
six tales of which it consists, having its scene laid in some famous
Spanish city, is preceded by a similar abridgment of the excellences of
the particular city to which it relates. Céspedes is the author of the

(Antonio, Bib. Nov., Tom. II. p. 83.) He shows, at the beginning of his
“Flema,” that he means to imitate Quevedo; but he has a good deal of
<i>cultismo</i> in his style. For the meaning of “Flema,” see Covarrubias,

Hombre en el Tribunal de la Fortuna y Casa de Descontentos, ideado

author goes to the house of “Desengaño,”—that peculiarly Castilian
word, which may here be translated <i>Truth</i>. He is led afterwards to the
palace and tribunal of Fortune, where he is disabused of his errors
concerning all earthly good. The fiction is of little worth, and the
style is that of the school of Góngora.</p>

or repeated in this volume, as the popular ballads sung in the streets
in honor of the Cid, are, it is curious to observe, <i>not</i> always to
be found in any of the Romanceros. Thus, the one on the insult to the
Cid’s father begins,—</p>

<p class="mt1">It is quite different from the ballad on the same
subject in any of the ballad-books. So is the one at p. 33, upon the
death of Count Lozano, as well as the one at p. 105, upon the Cid’s
insult to the Pope at Rome. On hearing the last sung in the streets,
the Cid is made, in the story, to cry out, “Is it pretended I was ever
guilty of such effrontery? I, whom God made a Castilian,—<i>I</i> treat the
great Shepherd of the Church so?—<i>I</i> be guilty of such folly? By St.
Peter, St. Paul, and St. Lazarus, with whom I held converse on earth,
you lie, base ballad-singer!” Several ballads might be taken from this
volume and added even to the “Romancero del Cid,” Keller, Stuttgard,
1840, which is the most ample of all the collections on the Cid.</p>

it.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_189"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_189">[189]</a></span> Italy is the only country that
can enter into competition with Spain in the department of tales,
during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Indeed, I am not
certain, considering the short period (a little more than a century)
during which Spanish tales were fashionable, that as many <i>in
proportion</i> were not produced as were produced of Italian tales in
Italy during the long period—four centuries and a half—in which they
have now been prevalent there. And if, to the Spanish tales found in
books professing and not professing to be collections of them, we add
the thousands used up in Spanish dramas, to which the elder Italian
theatre offers no counterpart, I suppose there can hardly be a doubt
that there are really more Spanish fictions of this class in existence
than there are Italian. If, however, we were to settle the point only
by a comparison of the meagre and imperfect catalogues of Spanish
stories in Antonio’s Bibliotheca with the admirably complete one of
Italian stories in the “Bibliografia delle Novelle Italiane,” by Gamba,
we should settle it differently. But, in any event, when speaking of
the Italian <i>novelle</i>, we should remember, that, until very lately,
the whole spirit and power of fiction in Italy, so to speak, have
been taken from the theatre and romances, and cast into these short
tales.</p>

fact, however, that Capmany, in his five important volumes devoted to
Spanish eloquence, has been able to find nothing in the seventeenth
century, either in the way of forensic orations or popular pulpit
eloquence, with which to fill his pages, but is obliged to resort to
the eloquent prose of history and philosophy, of ethics and religious
asceticism, tells at once, in a way not to be mistaken, the tale of
the deficiencies in Castilian eloquence, as the word <i>eloquence</i> is

Subsequently, when he had translated the remaining eleven books, he
dedicated the whole anew to Philip as king, (Anvers, 1556, 12mo,)
correcting and amending the first part carefully. Lope de Vega (in his
Dorotea, Acto IV. sc. 3) praises the version of Perez; but, like most

I think, is the one made at Lyons, without date, but supposed to be of
1598, and entitled “Pedaços de Historia,” etc.; but, the same year,
the contents of this volume were reprinted at Paris, with the more
appropriate title of “Relaciones.” Perez seems to have amused himself
with publishing different portions of his works at different times
and in different places; but the most complete collection is that of
Geneva, 1654, 12mo, pp. 1126. His life is admirably discussed by M.
Mignet, in his “Antonio Perez et Philippe II.” (2de édit., Paris,
1846). The work of Salvador Bermudez de Castro, entitled “Antonio
Perez, Estudios Históricos,” (Madrid, 1841, 8vo,) would be better worth
reading if the author had not permitted himself to indulge in fictions,
such as ballad poetry, which he calls the poetry of Perez, and which
he gives as part of the means Perez used to stir up the people of
Saragossa, but which is, no doubt, the work of Castro himself. The
lives of Perez in Baena (Tom. I., 1789, p. 121) and Latassa (Bib. Nov.,
Tom. II., 1799, p. 108) show how afraid men of letters were, as late
as the end of the eighteenth century, to approach any subject thus
connected with royalty. The works of Perez are strictly forbidden by
the Index Expurgatorius of the Inquisition to the last,—in 1790 and
1805. The letters of Perez to Essex are in pretty good Latin, and out
of his Spanish works there were early made two or three collections
of very acute and striking aphorisms, which have been several times
printed. There are many MS. letters of Perez at the Hague and
elsewhere, referred to by Mignet, and there is in the Royal Library
at Paris an important political treatise which bears his name, but
which, though strongly marked with his acuteness and brilliancy, Ochoa
hesitates to attribute to him. It is, however, I doubt not, his. (See
Ochoa, Manuscritos Españoles, pp. 158-166; and Seminario Erudito, Tom.
VIII. pp. 245 and 250.) Further accounts of Perez are to be found in
Llorente, Tom. III. pp. 316-375.</p>

Spanish literature in that department from which it attempts to make a
collection, since by far the greater part of it consists of old printed
dedications, formal epistles of approbation that had been prefixed
to books when they were first published, lives of authors that had
served as prefaces to their works, etc. The letters of Quevedo and
Lope are chiefly on literary subjects, and are scattered through their
respective writings. Those of Antonio and Solís are in a small volume
published by Mayans at Lyons, in 1733; to which may be added those at
the end of Antonio’s “Censura de Historias Fabulosas,” Madrid, 1742,
fol. The “Cartas Philologicas” of Cascales, (of which there is a neat
edition by Sanchez, Madrid, 1779, 8vo,) are to Spain and the age in
which they were written what the terse and pleasant letters published
by Melmoth, under the pseudonyme of Fitzosborne, are to England in the

<p id="Footnote_202"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_202">[202]</a></span> The best notice of Gerónimo
de Zurita is the one at the end of Part II. Chap. I. of Prescott’s
“Ferdinand and Isabella”;—the most ample is the folio volume of Diego
Josef Dormer, entitled “Progresos de la Historia en Aragon” (Zaragoza,
1680, folio); really a life of Zurita, published in his honor by
the Cortes of his native kingdom. There are several editions of his
Annals; and Latassa (Bib. Nueva, Tom. I. pp. 358-373) gives a list of
above forty of his works, nearly all unpublished, and none of them,
probably, of much value, except his History, to which, in fact, they
are generally subsidiary. He held several offices under Philip II.,
and there is a letter to him from the king in Dormer, (p. 109,) which
shows that he enjoyed much of the royal consideration; though, as I
have intimated, and as may be fully seen in Dormer, (Lib. II. c. 2, 3,
4,) he was much teased, at one time, by the censors of his History. The
first edition of the “Anales de la Corona de Aragon” was published in
different years, at Saragossa, between 1562 and 1580, to which a volume
of Indices was added in 1604, making seven volumes, folio, in all. The
third edition (Zaragoza, 1610-21, 7 tom. folio) is the one that is
preferred.</p>

<p class="ti1">Another volume was added to the Annals of Zurita
(Zaragoza, 1630, fol.) by Bartolomé Leonardo de Argensola, the poet,
who brought them down to 1520, and whose style is better than that in
Zurita’s portion; but not much of it is the work of Argensola, so heavy
is it with documents.</p>

<p class="ti1">I have said that Zurita was employed as secretary of
Philip II., from time to time; and such was the fact. But this title
often implied little except the right of the person who bore it to
receive a moderate salary from the public treasury;—a circumstance
which I mention because I have occasion frequently to notice authors
who were royal secretaries, from the time of Baena, the Jew, in the
days of John II., down to the disappearance of the Austrian family.
Thus Gonzalo Perez and his son Antonio were royal secretaries; so were
the two Quevedos, and many more. In 1605, Philip III. had twenty-nine
such secretaries. Clemencin, note to Don Quixote, Parte II. c. 47.</p>

Morales was first published in three folios, Alcalá, 1574-77; but the
best edition is that of Madrid, 1791, in six small quartos, to which
are commonly added two volumes, dated 1792, on Spanish Antiquities, and
three more, dated 1793, of his miscellaneous works;—the whole being
preceded by the work of Ocampo, in two volumes, already noticed, and
followed by the continuation of Sandoval, in one volume, a work of
about equal merit with that of Morales, and first printed at Pamplona,
in 1615, folio. The three authors, Ocampo, Morales, and Sandoval, taken
together, are thus made to fill twelve volumes, as if they belonged to
one work, to which is given the unsuitable title of “Corónica General
de España.”</p>

<p class="ti1">Morales, in his youth, cruelly mutilated his person, in
order to insure his priestly purity of life, and wellnigh died of the
consequences.</p>

<p class="ti1">I might have mentioned here the “Comentario de la Guerra
de Alemaña de Luis de Avila y Zuñiga,” a small volume, (Anvers, 1550,
12mo,) first printed in 1548, and frequently afterwards, both in Latin
and French, as well as in Spanish. It is an account of the campaigns
of Charles V. in Germany, in 1546 and 1547, prepared, probably, from
information furnished by the Emperor himself, (Navarra, Diálogos, 1567,
f. 13,) and written in a natural, but by no means polished, Castilian
style. Parts of it bear internal evidence of having been composed at
the very time of the events they record, and the whole is evidently
the work of one of the few personal friends Charles V. ever had; one,
however, who does not appear to much advantage in the private letters
of Guillaume van Male, printed by the Belgian Bibliophiles, in 1843.

<p class="ti1">It would be easy to add to these two writers on
ecclesiastical history the names of many more. Hardly a convent or
a saint of any note in Spain, during the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries, failed of especial commemoration; and each of the religious
orders and great cathedrals had at least one historian, and most of
them several. The number of books on Spanish ecclesiastical history
to be found in the list at the end of the second volume of Antonio’s
Bibliotheca Nova is, therefore, one that may well be called enormous.
Some of them, too, like the history of the order of St. Benedict, by
Yepes, and several of the histories of those orders that were both
knightly and religious, are of no little importance for the facts and
documents with which they are crowded. But nearly all of them are
heavy, monkish annals, and not one, I believe, has literary merit
enough to attract our attention.</p>

to his article <i>Mariana</i>; but, as is usual with him, in a manner that
shows his dislike of the Jesuits. I know the treatise “De Rege et Regis
Institutione” only in the edition “Typis Wechelianis,” 1611, 12mo; but
I believe that edition is not at all expurgated. Certainly, the passage
Lib. I. c. 6 is quite strong enough, in extenuation of the atrocious
crime of Jaques Clemens, to be open to severe animadversion. (Sismondi,
Hist. des Français, Paris, 8vo, Tom. XXII., 1839, p. 191.) From the
very remarkable letters of Loaysa, the confessor of Charles V., it
appears that the great Emperor himself was as little scrupulous as his
son in such matters. This renders the passage in Mariana more easy
of explanation. See Briefe an Kaiser Karl V., etc., von D. G. Heine,

authority and privileges. (Santander, Catalogue, 1792, 8vo, Tom. IV.
pp. 152, 153, article <i>Proceso del Padre Mariana</i>, MS. Lope de Vega,
Obras Sueltas, Tom. I. p. 295.) The “Discursus de Erroribus qui in
Formâ Gubernationis Societatis Jesu occurrunt,” written in Mariana’s
beautiful flowing style, was first printed at Bordeaux, 1625, 8vo, and
then again on the suppression of the order by Charles III.; but in the
Index Expurgatorius, (1667, p. 735,) where it is strictly prohibited,
it is craftily treated as if it were still in manuscript, and as if
its author were not certainly known. In the Index of 1790, he is still
censured with great severity. A considerable number of his unpublished
manuscripts is said to have been long preserved in the Jesuits’ Library
at Toledo.</p>

at Madrid, by Ibarra, (two vols. fol. 1780,) under the direction of
the Superintendents of the Royal Library;—a book whose mechanical
execution would do honor to any press in Europe. It is remarkable how
much Mariana amended his History in the successive editions during his
lifetime; the additions between 1608 and 1623 being equal, as stated by
the editors of that of 1780, to a moderate volume.</p>

Saavedra, República Literaria, Madrid, 1759, 4to, p. 44. Mariana admits
the want of critical exactness in some parts of his history, when,
replying to a letter of Lupercio de Argensola, who had noticed his
mistake in calling Prudentius a Spaniard, he says: “I never undertook
to make a history of Spain, in which I should verify every particular
fact; for if I had, I should never have finished it; but I undertook to
arrange in a becoming style, and in the Latin language, what others had
collected as materials for the fabric I desired to raise. To look up
authorities for every thing would have left Spain, for another series
of centuries, without a Latin History that could show itself in the
world.” J. A. Pellicer, Ensayo de una Biblioteca de Traductores, p.

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_210"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_210">[210]</a></span> The first attack on Mariana
was made by a Spaniard in Italy, who called himself Pedro Mantuano,
and who printed his “Advertencias” at Milan in 1611. Thomas Tamayo
de Vargas wrote a vituperative reply to it (Toledo, 1616, 4to). But
Mariana wisely refused to read either. The Marquis of Mondejar, a most
respectable authority, renewed the discussion, and his “Advertencias”
were published, (Valencia, 1746, folio,) with a preface by Mayans y
Siscar, somewhat mitigating their force. Still, neither these, which
are the principal criticisms that have appeared on Mariana, nor any
others, have, in the estimation of Spaniards, seriously interfered with
his claims to be regarded as the great historian of his country.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_212"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_212">[212]</a></span> During this period, embracing a
large part of the seventeenth century, two remarkable controversies
took place in Spain, which, by introducing a more critical caution into
historical composition, were not without their effect on Mariana, and
may have tended to diminish the number of his successors, by subjecting
history, in all its forms, to more rigorous rules. The discussions
referred to arose in consequence of two extraordinary forgeries, which,
for a time, created a great sensation throughout the country, and
deluded not a few intelligent men and honest scholars.</p>

<p class="ti1">The first related to certain metallic plates, sometimes
called “The Leaden Books,” which, having been prepared and buried for
the purpose several years before, were disinterred near Granada between
1588 and 1595, and, when deciphered, seemed to offer materials for
defending the favorite doctrine of the Spanish Church on the Immaculate
Conception, and for establishing the great corner-stone of Spanish
ecclesiastical history, the coming to Spain of the Apostle James,
the patron saint of the country. This gross forgery was received for
authentic history by Philip II., Philip III., and Philip IV., each of
whom, in a council of state, consisting of the principal personages of
the kingdom, solemnly adjudged it to be true; so that, at one period
of the discussion, some persons believed the “Leaden Books” would be
admitted into the Canon of the Scriptures. The question, however, was
in time settled at Rome, and they were decided, by the highest tribunal
of the Church, to be false and forged; a decision in which Spain soon
acquiesced.</p>

<p class="ti1">The other fraud was connected with this one of the
“Leaden Books,” whose authority it was alleged to confirm; but it was
much broader and bolder in its claims and character. It consisted of a
series of fragments of chronicles, circulated earlier in manuscript,
but first printed in 1610, and then represented to have come, in
1594, from the monastery of Fulda, near Worms, to Father Higuera,
of Toledo, a Jesuit, and a personal acquaintance of Mariana. They
purported, on their face, to have been written by Flavius Lucius
Dexter, Marcus Maximus, Heleca, and other primitive Christians, and
contained important and wholly new statements touching the early
civil and ecclesiastical history of Spain. They were, no doubt, an
imitation of the forgeries of John of Viterbo, given to the world about
a century before as the works of Berosus and Manetho; but the Spanish
forgeries were prepared with more learning and a nicer ingenuity.
Flattering fictions were fitted to recognized facts, as if both rested
on the same authority; new saints were given to churches that were
not well provided in this department of their hagiology; a dignified
origin was traced for noble families, that had before been unable to
boast of their founders; and a multitude of Christian conquests and
achievements were hinted at or recorded, that gratified the pride of
the whole nation, the more because they had never till then been heard
of. Few doubted what it was so agreeable to all to believe. Sandoval,
Tamayo de Vargas, Lorenzo Ramirez de Prado, and, for a time, Nicolas
Antonio,—all learned men,—were persuaded that these summaries of
chronicles, or <i>chronicones</i>, as they were called, were authentic; and
if Arias Montano, the editor of the Polyglot, Mariana, the historian,
and Antonio Agustin, the cautious and critical friend of Zurita,
held an opposite faith, they did not think it worth while openly to
avow it. The current of opinion, in fact, ran strongly in favor of
the forgeries; and they were generally regarded as true history till
about 1650 or a little later, and therefore till long after the death
of their real author, Father Higuera, which happened in 1624. The
discussion about them, however, which, it is evident, was going quietly
on during much of this time, was useful. Doubts were multiplied; the
disbelief in their genuineness, which had been expressed to Higuera
himself, as early as 1595, by the modest and learned Juan Bautista
Perez, Bishop of Segorbe, gradually gained ground; writers of history
grew cautious; and at last, in 1652, Nicolas Antonio began his
“Historias <i>Fabulosas</i>”; a huge folio, which he left unfinished at
his death, and which was not printed till long afterwards, but which,
with its cumbrous, though clear-sighted learning, left no doubt as to
the nature and extent of the fraud of Father Higuera, and made his
case a teaching to all future Spanish historians, that does not seem
to have been lost on them. See the Chronicle of Dexter at the end of
Antonio’s Bibliotheca Vetus; the Historias Fabulosas of Antonio, with
the Life of its author prefixed by Mayans y Siscar, (Madrid, 1742,
folio,) to show the grossness of the whole imposture; and the “Chrónica
Universal” of Alonso Maldonado, (Madrid, 1624, folio,) to show how
implicitly it was then believed and followed by learned men. The man of
learning who was the most clear-sighted about “The Leaden Books” and
the <i>chronicones</i>, and who behaved with the most courage in relation
to them from the first, was, I suppose, the Bishop of Segorbe, who is
noticed in Villanueva, “Viage Literario á las Iglesias de España,”
(Madrid, 1804, 8vo, Tom. III. p. 166,) together with the document (pp.
259-278) in which he exposes the whole fraud, but which was never
before published.</p>

translation of it, which I have seen, had appeared at Venice in 1568,
and I believe there was another at Zaragoza in 1584, of which it seems
strange that Garcilasso knew nothing. (Barbosa, Bib. Lus., Tom. II. p.
920; Castro, Bib., Tom. I. p. 371; and Antonio, Bib. Nov., Tom. I. p.
232.) The letter of Garcilasso to Philip II., with additional remarks
by its author, containing interesting materials for his own life, is
prefixed to the first edition of the second part of the Commentaries
on Peru. “La Florida” was printed at Lisbon in 1606, 4to; the first
part of the Peru at Lisbon, 1609, folio; and the second part at
Córdova, 1617, folio. Both of the historical works are to be found in
several other editions, and both have been translated into most of the

<p class="ti1">Two striking examples may be given of the opposite kinds
of that credulity in Garcilasso which so much impairs the value of his
Commentaries. He believed that the subjection of Peru by the Spaniards
was predicted by the last of the Incas that reigned before their
arrival, (Parte I. Lib. IX. c. 15, and Parte II. Lib. VIII. c. 18,)
and he believed that all the Spaniards in the army of Peru, who were
notorious blasphemers, perished by wounds in the <i>mouth</i> (Parte II.,
Lib. IV. c. 21).</p>

of the History of Mexico, but they are not now known to exist.” A few
of his letters, with a sketch of his life, by Mayans y Siscar, were
published, as I have already noticed, in 1733. They appear again,
carefully revised, in the “Cartas Morales,” etc., 1773. See, <i>ante</i>,

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_222"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_222">[222]</a></span> From the times of Charles V. and
Philip II., when, in Aragon and Castile, chroniclers were multiplied
as a part of the pageantry of the court, the rest of the kingdoms that
entered into the united Spanish monarchy began to desire to have their
own separate histories, as we can see in Valencia, where those of
Beuter, Escolano, and Diago were written. Besides this, a great number
of the individual cities obtained their own separate annals from the
hand of at least one author,—sometimes works of authority, like that
on Segovia by Colmenares, and that on Seville by Avila y Zuñiga. But
though more of such local histories were written in Spain between the
middle of the sixteenth and the end of the seventeenth centuries, than
were written during the same period, I believe, in any other country
in Europe, none of them, so far as I know, has such peculiar merit
as to be noticeable in the literary history of the country. Still,
the spirit that produced them in such great numbers, and especially
the spirit which, during the reign of Philip II., made, with so much
care and cost, the vast collections of documents yet to be found in
the Castle of Simancas and the convent of the Escurial, should not be
overlooked.</p>

<p class="ti1">When the chapter on the Chronicles of the fifteenth
century (First Period, Chap. IX.) was printed, I had not seen the
Chronicle by the Prince of Viana, “Crónica de los Reyes de Navarra,”—of
which there is only one edition, that of Pamplona, 1843, 4to, by Don
José Yanguas y Miranda. It was written in 1454 by the Prince Don
Carlos, to whom I have already alluded, (Vol. I. p. 332, note,) who
died, forty years old, in 1461, and whose translation of Aristotle’s
Ethics was printed at Saragossa in 1509. (Mendez, Typographia, 1796, p.
193.) The Chronicle was carefully prepared for publication from four
manuscripts, and it embraces the history of Navarre from the earliest
times to the accession of Charles III. in 1390, noticing a few events
in the beginning of the next century. Besides the life of the author,
it makes about 200 pages, written in a modest, simple style, but not so
good as that of some of the contemporary Castilian chronicles. A few of
the old traditions concerning the little mountain kingdom, whose early
annals it records, are, however, well preserved; some of them being
told as they are found in the General Chronicle of Spain, and some with
additions or changes. The portions where I have observed most traces
of connection between the two are in the Chronicle of the Prince of
Viana, Book I. chapters 9-14, as compared with the latter portion of
the General Chronicle, Part III. Sometimes the Prince deviates from all
received accounts, as when he calls Cava the <i>wife</i> of Count Julian,
instead of calling her his <i>daughter</i>; but, on the whole, his Chronicle
agrees with the common traditions and histories of the period to which
it relates.</p>

Spain for so long a period, Alfonso VI. determined to throw a copy of
each into a fire duly kindled and blessed for the purpose, and give
the supremacy to the one that should come out unconsumed. The Gothic
MS. was successful; but the king broke his word, and tossed it back
into the flames, thus giving rise, it is said, to the proverb, “Alla
van leyes adonde quieren reyes”; or, freely translated, “Laws obey
kings.” (Sarmiento, § 411.) A similar historical origin is given to the
proverb, “Ni quito rey, ni pongo rey”; which is traced to the personal
quarrel of Peter the Cruel and his brother and successor, Don Enrique.

Teresa was beatified in 1614, and canonized in 1622; besides which, in

of Spain with Santiago; an honor that was long resisted, but was urged

somewhat similar book had preceded it, “The History of the Queen of
Sheba, when she discoursed with King Solomon in Jerusalem.” It was
written by another Augustinian monk, Alonso de Horosco, a somewhat
voluminous writer, and was printed at Salamanca, in 1568, 12mo. But it
is little more than a collection of ordinary sermons, some of which
do not mention the Queen of Sheba at all, and is to be regarded only
as a courtly offering to Isabella, wife of Philip II., whose chaplain
Horosco was.</p>

(Madrid, 1621, 4to) a volume of five hundred pages, entitled, “Varias
Noticias importantes á la Humana Comunicacion,” which he divides into
twenty essays, entitled “Variedades.” It is less well written than the
Pasagero, falling more into the faults of the time. The seventeenth
Essay, however, which is on Domestic Life, with illustrations from
Spanish history, is pleasant. His “Plaza Universal de las Ciencias,”
first printed at Madrid, in 1615, 4to, and reprinted in folio, with
large changes and additions, in 1737, is an attempt at a compendium of
human knowledge, curious in the first edition, as showing the state of
knowledge and opinion at that time in Spain, but of little value in
either.</p>

interesting autobiography of its author, beginning with his birth
at Jaen and his education at Seville, and giving his travels, for
thirty-nine years, all over the world, including China, America, many

His father and mother were Germans, who came to Spain with the Empress
of Austria, Doña Maria, but he himself was born at Madrid in 1595,
and died there in 1658. Antonio (Bib. Nov., Tom. I. p. 686) and Baena
(Tom. III. p. 190) give long lists of his works, chiefly in Latin. The
“Contemplations on the State of Man,” published in 1684, seventeen
years after the death of Jeremy Taylor, <i>as his work</i>, turns out to
have been substantially taken from a treatise of Nieremberg, first
published as early as 1654, and entitled “Diferencia de lo Temporal
y Eterno”; the “Contemplations,” however, being a <i>rifacimento</i> of
an English translation of the work of Nieremberg, by Sir Vivian
Mullineaux, published in 1672. (See an interesting pamphlet on this
subject, “Letter to Joshua Watson, Esq., etc., by Edw. Churton, M.
A., Archdeacon of Cleveland,” London, 1848, 8vo.) Why the fraud was
not earlier detected, since Heber and others had noted the difference
between the style of this work and that of Bishop Taylor’s works
generally, it is difficult to tell. The treatise of Nieremberg has
always been valued in Spanish, and, besides being early translated
into Latin, Italian, French, and English, was published in Arabic in
1733-34, at the Convent of St. John, on the Mountain of the Druses. See

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_258"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_258">[258]</a></span> Before we come into the period
when bad taste overwhelmed every thing, we should slightly refer to
a few authors who were not infected by it, and who yet are not of
importance enough to be introduced into the text.</p>

<p class="ti1">The first of them is Diego de Estella, who was born
in 1524, and died in 1578. He was much connected with the great
diplomatist, Cardinal Granvelle, and published many works in Latin and
Spanish, the best of which, as to style and manner, are “The Vanity of
the World,” 1574, and “Meditations on the Love of God,” 1578.</p>

<p class="ti1">Several treatises in the form of biography, but
really ascetic and didactic in their character, were published soon
afterwards, which are written with some purity and vigor; such as the
Life of Pius V., (1595,) by Antonio Fuenmayor, who died at the early
age of thirty; the Life of Santa Teresa, (1599,) by Diego de Yepes,
one of her correspondents, and the confessor of the last dark years of
Philip II.; and the Lives of two devout women, Doña Sancha Carillo, and
Doña Ana Ponce de Leon, (1604,) by Martin de Roa, a Jesuit, who long
represented the interests of his Society at the court of Rome.</p>

<p class="ti1">To these may be added three other works of very
different characters.</p>

<p class="ti1">The “Examen de Ingenios,” or How to determine, from
the Physical and External Condition, who are fit for Training in the
Sciences, by Juan de Huarte, (Alcalá, 1640, 12mo, first published
in 1566,) is one of them. It enjoyed a prodigious reputation in its
time, was often published in Spanish, and was translated into all the
principal languages of Europe; into English by Richard Carew, 1594;
and, as late as the middle of the eighteenth century, into German by
a person no less distinguished than Lessing, whose version, entitled
“Prüfung der Köpfe,” was printed for the second time at Wittenberg,
1785, 12mo. It is a work full of striking, but often wild, conjectures
in physiology, written in a forcible, clear style, and Lessing aptly
compares its author to a spirited horse, that, in galloping over the
stones, never strikes fire so brilliantly as he does when he stumbles.
It is praised by Forner, (Obras, Madrid, 1843, 8vo, Tom. I. p. 61,) and
is on the Index Expurgatorius of 1667, p. 734. The “Examen de Maridos,”
a spirited play of Alarcon, (see, <i>ante</i>, II. 322,) and the “Vexamen
de Ingenios,” a lively prose satire of Cancer, (Obras, 1761, p. 105,)
were, I suppose, understood by their contemporaries to have reference
to the title of the “Examen de Ingenios,” then very popular. A work not
unlike the “Examen de Ingenios” appeared at Barcelona, (1637, 4to,)
entitled “El Sol Solo, etc., y Anatomía de Ingenios,” taking a view of
the same subject more in the nature of Physiognomy, and not without
an approach to what has since been called Phrenology. It was written
by Estevan Pujasol, an Aragonese; and is curious for its manner of
treating the subjects it discusses,—half anatomical, half spiritual;
but is not otherwise interesting.</p>

<p class="ti1">The second is the “Historia Moral y Philosóphica” of
Pero Sanchez of Toledo, published at Toledo, 1590, folio, when its
author, who was connected with the cathedral there, was already an old
man. It consists of the Lives of distinguished men of antiquity, like
Plato, Alexander, and Cicero, and ends with a treatise on Death;—each
of the Lives being accompanied by moral and Christian reflections,
which are sometimes written in a flowing and fervent style, but are
rarely appropriate, and never original or powerful.</p>

<p class="ti1">The last is by Vincencio Carducho, a Florentine painter,
who, when quite a boy, was brought to Spain in 1585, by his brother
Bartolomé, and died there in 1638, having risen to considerable
eminence in his art. In 1634, he published, at Madrid, “Diálogos de
la Pintura, su Defensa, Orígen,” etc. (4to, 229 leaves); but the
<i>licencias</i> are dated 1632 and 1633. It is written in good plain prose,
without particular merit as to style, and is declared by Cean Bermudez,
(Diccionario, Tom. I. p. 251,) in his notice of the author, to be “el
mejor libro que tenemos de pintura en Castellano.” At the end is an
Appendix, in which are attacks of Lope de Vega, Juan de Jauregui, and
others, on a duty laid upon pictures, which, Cean Bermudez says, “the
efforts of Carducho and his friends succeeded in removing in 1637.”</p>

homely philosophy. I find no notice of it, though the author, in his
Dedication, intimates that it is not his first published work. It seems
to have been written soon after the death of Philip III. in 1621, and
its last dialogue is against <i>cultismo</i>, of the introduction of which

p. 294, and in the dedication to Lastañosa of the first edition of
Quevedo’s “Fortuna con Seso,” 1650. His poem on “The Four Seasons,”
generally printed at the end of his Works, is, I believe, the worst of
them; certainly it would be difficult to find much in any language more
absurd and extravagant in its false taste.</p>

<p id="Footnote_261"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_261">[261]</a></span> Juan de Zabaleta flourished
as an author from 1653 to 1667; and his works, which were soon
collected, have been frequently printed, 1667, Madrid, 1728, 4to, 1754,
etc. (Baena, Tom. III. p. 227.)—Christóval Lozano (noticed, pp. <a
href="#Page_91">91</a>, <a href="#Page_108">108</a>) was known as an
author from 1656, by his “David Arrepentido,” to which he afterwards
added his “David Perseguido,” in three volumes, and yet another
work on the subject of David’s Example illustrated by the Light of
Christianity; all of little value.—Juan Francisco Fernandez de Heredia
wrote “Trabajos y Afanes de Hercules,” Madrid, 1682, 4to. He makes it
a kind of book of emblems, but it is one of the worst of its conceited
class. Latassa (Bib. Nov., Tom. IV. p. 3) notices him.</p>

<p class="ti1">Of Antonio Perez Ramirez, I know only the “Armas contra
la Fortuna,” (Madrid, 1698, 4to,) which is a translation of Boëthius,
with dissertations in the worst possible taste interspersed between its
several divisions.</p>

<p class="ti1">One other author might, perhaps, have been placed at
the side of Lozano,—Joseph de la Vega,—who published (at Amsterdam in
1688, 12mo) three dialogues, entitled, “Confusion de Confusiones,” to
ridicule the passion for stockjobbing which came in with the Dutch East
India Company, in 1602, and was then at the height of its frenzy. They
are somewhat encumbered with learning, but contain anecdotes, ancient
and modern, very well told. The author was a rich Jew of Antwerp, who
had fled thither from Spain, and published several works between 1683
and 1693, but none, I think, of much value. Amador de los Rios, Judíos
Españoles, p. 633.</p>

<p id="Footnote_262"><span class="label"><a

in the sixth volume of the “Seminario Erudito,” on the causes of the
decline of Spain;—remarkable because, though written in the reign of
Philip IV., by Juan de Palafox y Mendoza, an ecclesiastic of rank, whom
Charles III. afterwards asked to have canonized, it yet attributes the
origin of the prostration under which Spain suffered in his time mainly
to the war with the Netherlands.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_263"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_263">[263]</a></span> There is a great discrepancy
in the accounts of the number of Moriscos expelled from Spain,
1609-11,—several making it a million, and one reducing it so low as
a hundred and sixty thousand. But, whatever may have been the number
expelled, all accounts agree as to the disastrous effects produced on
a population already decaying by the loss of so many persons, who had
long been the most skilful manufacturers and agriculturists in the
kingdom; effects to which the many <i>despoblados</i> noted on our recent
maps of Spain still bear melancholy testimony. (Clemencin, Notes to Don
Quixote, Parte II. c. 54.) In stating six hundred thousand to have been
the number driven out, I have taken the reckoning of Circourt, (Tom.
III. p. 103,) which seems made with care.</p>

<p class="ti1">These unhappy persons had among them a good deal of
Castilian culture, whose traces still remain in manuscripts, which,
like that of the old poem of Joseph, already described, (Period I.
chap. 5,) are composed in Spanish, but are written throughout in the
Arabic character. Of parts of two such manuscripts I possess copies,
through the kindness of Don Pascual de Gayangos. The first is a poem
written in 1603, and entitled, “Discourse on the Light, and Descent,
and Lineage of our Chief and Blessed Prophet, Mohammed Çalam, composed
and compiled by his Servant, who most needs his Pardon, Mohammed
Rabadan, a Native of Rueda, on the River Xalon.” It is divided into
eight Histories, of which I possess the fourth, entitled, “History
of Hexim,” who was one of the ancestors of the Prophet. It contains
above two thousand lines in the short, Castilian ballad measure, and
is remarkably Arabic and Mohammedan in its general tone, though with
occasional allusions to the Greek mythology. It is, too, not without
poetical merit, as in the following lines, which open the second canto,
and describe the auspicious morning of Hexim’s marriage.</p>

<p class="mt1">In the preface to the whole poem, the author says Allah
alone knows how much labor it has cost him to collect the manuscripts
necessary for his task, “scattered,” he adds, “as they were, all over
Spain, and lost and hidden through fear of the Inquisition.”</p>

<p class="ti1">The other work to which I refer is chiefly in prose, and
is anonymous. Its author says he was driven from Spain in 1610, and was
landed at Tunis with above three thousand of his unhappy countrymen,
who, through the long abode of their race in a Christian land and
under the fierce persecutions of the Inquisition, had not only so lost
a knowledge of the rites and ceremonies of their religion, that it
was necessary to indoctrinate them like children, but had so lost all
proper knowledge of the Arabic, that it was necessary to do it through
the Castilian. The Bashaw of Tunis, therefore, sent for the author,
and commanded him to write a book in Castilian, for the instruction of
these singular neophytes. He did so, and produced the present work,
which he called “Mumin,” or the Believer in Allah; a word which he
uses to signify a city populous and fortified, which is attacked by
the Vices and defended by the Virtues of the Mohammedan religion, and
in which one of the personages relates a history of his own life,
adventures, and sufferings; all so given as to instruct, sometimes by
direct precept and sometimes by example, the newly arrived Moriscos
in their duties and faith. It is, of course, partly allegorical and
romantic. Its air is often Arabic, and so is its style occasionally;
but some of its scenes are between lovers at grated windows, as if
in a Castilian city, and it is interspersed with Castilian poems by
Montemayor, Góngora, and the Argensolas, with, perhaps, some by the
author himself, who seems to have been a man of cultivation and of a
gentle spirit. Of this manuscript I have eighty pages,—about a fifth of
the whole.</p>

<p class="ti1">Further notices on the Morisco-Spanish literature may
be found in an account by the Orientalist, Silvestre de Sacy, of two
manuscripts in France, like those just described (Ochoa, Manuscritos
Españoles, 1844, pp. 6-21); but a more ample and satisfactory
discussion of it occurs in a learned article in the British and Foreign
Review, January, 1839.</p>

<p class="ti1">It should be remembered that <i>Morisco</i> was substituted
for <i>Moro</i>, after the overthrow of the Moorish power in Spain, as an
expression of the contempt with which the Christian Spaniards have
never ceased to pursue their old conquerors and hated enemies, from the
time of the fall of Granada to the present day.</p>

<p class="ti1">Encouraged by the expulsion of the Jews, in 1492, and
by that of the Moors, in 1609-11, Don Sancho de Moncada, a professor
in the University of Toledo, addressed Philip III., in a discourse
published in 1619, urging that monarch to drive out the Gypsies. But he
failed. His discourse is in Hidalgo, “Romances de Germania,” (Madrid,
1779, 8vo,) and is translated by Borrow, in his remarkable work on the
Gypsies (London, 1841, 8vo, Vol. I. chap. xi.). Salazar de Mendoza, at
the end of his “Dignidades de Castilla,” published in 1618, says he had
himself prepared a memorial to the same effect, for driving out the
Gypsies; and he adds, in a true Castilian spirit, that “it is being
over-nice to tolerate such a pernicious and perverse race.”</p>

books that can be consulted, to illustrate the character and feelings
of all classes of society in Spain at the end of the seventeenth
century, is the “Relacion,” etc., of this “Auto General” of 1680,
published immediately afterwards at Madrid, by Joseph del Olmo, one
of the persons who had been most busy in its arrangements. It is a
small quarto of 308 pages, and gives, as if describing a magnificent
theatrical pageant, the details of the scene, which began at seven
o’clock in the morning of June 30th, and was not over till nine o’clock
of the following morning, the king and queen sitting in their box
or balcony, to witness it, fourteen hours of that time. Eighty-five
grandees entered themselves as especial <i>familiares</i>, or servants, of
the Holy Office, to do honor to the occasion; and the king sent from
his own hand the first faggot to the accursed pile. The whole number
of victims exhibited was one hundred and twenty, of whom twenty-one
were burnt alive; but it does not appear that the royal party actually
witnessed this portion of the atrocities. From the whole account,
however, there can be no doubt that devout Spaniards generally regarded
the exhibition with favor, and most of them with a much stronger
feeling. Madame d’Aulnoy (Voyage, Tom. III. p. 154) had a description
of the ceremonies intended for this <i>auto da fé</i> given to her, as if it
were to be an honor to the monarchy, by one of the Counsellors of the
Inquisition; but I think she left Madrid before it occurred.</p>

that men owe to ‘both their Majesties’; and a foreigner is often
surprised at the hopes expressed by Spaniards, that ‘his Majesty’ will
be pleased to grant them life and health for some years more.” The
Dict. of the Academy, 1736, verb. <i>Magestad</i>, illustrates this still

Castellana,” (Mexico, 1609, 4to, ff. 83) is a pleasant and important
treatise, which, as the novelist intimates, he began to write in
Castile and finished in Mexico. It proposes to reverse the letter ↄ in
order to express the soft <i>ch</i> as in <i>mucho</i>, to be printed <i>muↄo</i>;
uses two forms of the letter <i>r</i>; writes the conjunction <i>y</i> always
<i>i</i>, as Salvá now insists it should be; and claims <i>j</i>, <i>ll</i>, and <i>ñ</i>
to be separate letters, as they have long been admitted to be.</p>

<p class="ti1">In speaking of Aleman, I am reminded of his “San Antonio
de Padua,” printed in 12mo, at Valencia, in 1607, ff. 309. It belongs
to the same class of books with the “San Patricio” of Montalvan, (see,
<i>ante</i>, Vol. II. p. 298,) but is more elaborate and more devout.
The number of the Saint’s miracles that it records is very great.
Whether he invented any of them for the occasion, I do not know; but
they sometimes read as much like <i>novelas</i> as some of his stories in
the “Guzman” do, and are always written in the same idiomatic and
unadulterated Castilian. It is introduced by a <i>cancion</i> in honor of
it by Lope de Vega; but I cannot find that it was ever reprinted;—why,
it is difficult to say, for it is an uncommonly attractive book of its
class.</p>

<p id="Footnote_283"><span class="label"><a

orthography are set forth in the “Diálogo de las Lenguas” (Mayans y
Siscar, Orígenes, Tom. II. pp. 47-65); but the ingenious author of that
discussion is more severe than was necessary on Lebrixa. An anonymous
writer of an excellent essay on the same subject, in the first volume
of the Repertorio Americano, (Tom. I. p. 27,) is a great deal more
judicious. But how unsettled much still remains in practice may be
seen in the “Manual del Cajista, por José María Palacios,” Madrid,
1845, 18mo, where (pp. 134-154) is a “Prontuario de las Voces de dudosa
Ortografía,” containing above 1800 words.</p>

<p id="Footnote_284"><span class="label"><a

already spoken, (Vol. I. p. 549,) and the memory of it was now so much
revived that a counterfeit edition of it was published, about 1775,
in small folio, hardly, I should judge from its appearance, with the
intention of deceiving. But such things were not uncommon about that
time, as Mendez says, who thinks the edition in question had been
printed about twenty years when he published his work in 1796. (See
Typog., p. 242.) It is, however, already so rare, that I obtained a
copy of it with difficulty.</p>

<p class="ti1">That of Gayoso was first printed at Madrid, in 1745,
12mo, and that of San Pedro in Valencia, 1769, 12mo, which last
Gayoso, disguising himself under a sort of anagram, attacked, in his
“Conversaciones Críticas, por Don Antonio Gobeyos,” (Madrid, 1780,
12mo,) where he shows that San Pedro was not so original as he ought to
have been, but treats his Grammar with more harshness than it deserved.
Salvá’s “Gramática de la Lengua Castellana como ahora se halla” was
first printed in 1831, and the sixth edition appeared at Madrid in
1844, 12mo; a striking proof of the want of such a book.</p>

by José Cobo de la Torre, besides which it is inserted in the “Rebusco
de las Obras Literarias de J. F. de Isla,” (Madrid, 1790, 12mo,) as if
it were unquestionably Isla’s. It first appeared in the second edition
of the sixth volume of the “Diario de los Literatos”;—the earliest
periodical work in the spirit of modern criticism that was published in
Spain, and one so much in advance of the age that it did not survive
its second year, having been begun in 1737, and gone on one year and
nine months, till it made seven small volumes. It was in vain that it
was countenanced by the king, and favored by the leading persons at
court. It was too large a work; it was a new thing, which Spaniards
rarely like; and it was severe in its criticisms, so that the authors
of the time generally took the field against it, and broke it down.</p>

it are found in Sedano, Quintana, etc. The octaves he recited at the
opening of the Academy of Fine Arts, in 1752, and published at p. 21 of
the “Abertura Solemne,” etc., printed in honor of the occasion (Madrid,
folio); and the similar poems recited by him at a distribution of
prizes by the same Academy, in 1754, and published in their “Relacion,”
etc., (Madrid, folio, pp. 51-61,) prove rather the dignity of his
social position than any thing else. Latassa gives a long account of
his unpublished works.</p>

<p class="ti1">Many of the best materials for the state of culture
in Spain, during the reign of Charles III., are to be found in the
“Biblioteca de los Mejores Escritores del Reynado de Carlos III.,
por Juan Sempere y Guarinos,” Madrid, 1785-89, 6 tom. 8vo. When the
author published it, he was about thirty-five years old, having been
born in 1754; but he was afterwards much more distinguished as a
political writer, by his “Observaciones sobre las Cortes,” (1810,) his
“Historia de las Cortes,” (1815,) and other labors of the same kind.
His first acknowledged work was a free translation, from Muratori,
of an essay, with additions, which he printed at Madrid, in 1782, in
12mo, with the title, “Sobre el Buen Gusto,” and which he accompanied
by an original tract, “Sobre el Buen Gusto actual de los Españoles en
la Literatura,”—the last being afterwards prefixed, with alterations,
to his “Biblioteca.” He was a diligent and useful writer, and died, I
believe, in 1824. A small volume, containing notices of his life to the
time when it appeared, probably derived from materials furnished by
himself, was printed at Madrid, by Amarita, in 1821, 12mo.</p>

a little earlier, had translated much from the French. (Sempere,
Biblioteca, Tom. VI. p. 231.) This work, too, the author declared to be
a translation, and, like Isla, set forth on his title-page that it was
“restored to the language in which it was originally written.” But the
whole is a worthless fiction, title-page and all, though the attempt to
make out for Gil Blas a clear and noble genealogy on the side of his
mother must be admitted to be a truly Spanish fancy. (See Libros III. y

I. p. xxxix., where Voltaire is said to have been attacked by Le Sage,
in one of his dramas; besides which it is supposed Le Sage ridiculed
him under the name of Triaquero, in Gil Blas, Lib. X. c. 5. But the
most important and curious discussion concerning the authorship of
Gil Blas is the one that was carried on, between 1818 and 1822, by
François de Neufchâteau and Antonio de Llorente, the author of the
History of the Inquisition. It began with a memoir, by the first, read
to the French Academy, (1818,) and an edition of Gil Blas, (Paris,
1820, 3 tom. 8vo,) in both of which he maintains Le Sage to be the
true author of that romance. To both Llorente replied by a counter
memoir, addressed to the French Academy, and by his “Observations sur
Gil Blas,” (Paris, 1822, 12mo,) and his “Observaciones sobre Gil Blas”
(Madrid, 1822, 12mo); two works not exactly alike, but substantially
so, and equally maintaining that Gil Blas is Spanish in its origin,
and probably the work of Solís, the historian, who, as Llorente
<i>conjectures</i>, wrote a romance in Spanish, entitled, “El Bachiller
de Salamanca,” the manuscript of which coming into the possession of
Le Sage, he first plundered from it the materials for his Gil Blas,
which he published in 1715-35, and then gave the world the remainder
as the “Bachelier de Salamanque,” in 1738. This theory of Llorente is
explained, with more skill than is shown in its original framing, by
the late accomplished scholar, Mr. A. H. Everett, in an article which
first appeared in the North American Review, for October, 1827, when
its author was Minister of the United States in Spain, and afterwards
in his pleasant “Critical and Miscellaneous Essays,” published in
Boston, 1845, 12mo.</p>

<p id="Footnote_338"><span class="label"><a

“No hay Amigo para Amigo,” which is the first play in the Comedias de
Roxas, 1680;—and “Don Cesar Ursino” is from “Peor esta que estaba,”
in Calderon, Comedias, 1763, Tom. III. The errors of Gil Blas in
Spanish geography and history are constantly pointed out by Llorente
as blunders of Le Sage in the careless use of his original; while,
on the other hand, Fr. de Neufchâteau points out its allusions to
Parisian society in the time of Le Sage. But of his free use of
Spanish fictions, which he took no pains to conceal, the proof is
abundant. I have already noticed, when speaking of Espinel, (<i>ante</i>,
<a href="#Page_67">pp. 67-70</a>,) how much Le Sage took from “Marcos
de Obregon”; but, besides this, the adventures of Don Rafael with the
Seigneur de Moyadas in Gil Blas (Lib. V. c. 1) are taken from “Los
Empeños del Mentir” of Mendoza (Fenix Castellano, 1690, p. 254);—the
story of the Marriage de Vengeance in Gil Blas (Lib. IV. c. 4) is
from the play of Roxas, “Casarse por Vengarse”;—the story of Aurora
de Guzman in Gil Blas (Lib. IV. c. 5 and 6) is from “Todo es enredos
Amor,” by Diego de Córdoba y Figueroa;—and so on. See Tieck’s <i>Vorrede</i>
to his translation of Marcos de Obregon (1827); Adolfo de Castro’s
Poesías de Calderon y Plagios de Le Sage, (Cadiz, 1845, 18mo, a curious
little pamphlet); and the fourth book of the same author’s “Conde Duque
de Olivares” (Cadiz, 1846, 8vo). In his “Bachelier de Salamanque,” Le
Sage goes one step further. On the title-page of this romance, first
printed three years after the last volume of Gil Blas appeared, he
says expressly, that “it is translated from a Spanish manuscript,” and
yet the story of Doña Cintia de la Carrera, in the fifty-fourth and
fifty-fifth chapters, is taken from Moreto’s “Desden con el Desden”; a
play as well known as any in Spanish literature.</p>

the Academy, in 1770; both of little consequence, but not, I believe,
noticed elsewhere. His “Obras Póstumas” were printed at Barcelona, in

Sobre las Fiestas de Toros,” (Madrid, 1777, 12mo,) which is a slight
prose tract, is intended to prove historically that the amusement
of bull-fighting is Spanish in its origin and character;—a point
concerning which those who have read the Chronicles of Muntaner and the
Cid can have little doubt. Moratin had the power of improvisating with
great effect. Obras, 1825, pp. xxxiv.-xxxix.</p>

<p id="Footnote_351"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_351">[351]</a></span> A few words should be added, on
each of these last five authors.</p>

<p class="ti1">1. “Las Odas de Leon de Arroyal,” Madrid, 1784, 12mo. At
the end are a few worthless Anacreontics by a lady, whose name is not
given; and at the beginning is a truly Spanish definition of lyrical
poetry, namely, that “whose verses can be properly played, sung, or
<i>danced</i>.”</p>

<p class="ti1">2. Pedro de Montengon, “Eusebio,” Madrid, 1786-87, 4
tom. 8vo. The first two volumes gave great offence by the absence of
all injunctions to make religious instruction a part of education; and,
though the remaining two made up for this deficiency, there is reason
to believe that Montengon intended originally to follow the theory of
the “Emile.” “El Antenor” (Madrid, 1788, 2 tom. 8vo) is a prose poem
on the tradition of the founding of Padua by the Trojans. “El Rodrigo”
(Madrid, 1793, 8vo) is another prose epic, in one volume and twelve
books, on the “Last of the Goths.” “Eudoxia,” Madrid, 1793, 8vo; again,
a work on education; but on the education of women. “Odas,” Madrid,
1794, 8vo; very poor. Montengon, of whom these are not all the works,
was born at Alicante, in 1745, and was alive in 1815. He was very
young when he entered the Church, and lived chiefly at Naples, where
he threw off his ecclesiastical robes and devoted himself to secular
occupations.</p>

<p class="ti1">3. Francisco Gregorio de Salas, “Coleccion de
Epigramas,” etc., 1792, 4th edition, Madrid, 1797, 2 tom. 12mo. His
“Observatorio Rústico” (1770, tenth edition 1830) is a long dull
eclogue, divided into six parts, which has enjoyed an unreasonable
popularity. L. F. Moratin (Obras, 1830, Tom. IV. pp. 287 and 351) gives
an epitaph for Salas, with a pleasing prose account of his personal
character, which he well says was much more interesting than his
poetry; and Sempere (Biblioteca, Tom. V. pp. 69, etc.) gives a list of
his works, all of which, I believe, are in the collection printed at
Madrid in 1797, <i>ut sup.</i> A small volume entitled “Parabolas Morales,”
etc., (Madrid, 1803, 12mo,) consisting of prose apologues, somewhat
better than any thing of Salas that preceded it, is, I suppose, later,
and probably the last of his works.</p>

<p class="ti1">4. Ignacio de Meras, “Obras Poéticas,” (Madrid, 1797, 2
tom. 12mo,) contain a stiff tragedy, called “Teonea,” in blank verse,
and within the rules; a comedy called “The Ward of Madrid,” in the old
<i>figuron</i> style, but burlesque and dull; an epic canto on “The Conquest
of Minorca,” in 1782, to imitate Moratin’s “Ships of Cortés”; a poem
“On the Death of Barbarossa, in 1518”; and a number of sonnets and
odes, some of the last of which should rather be called ballads, and
some of them satires;—the whole very meagre.</p>

<p class="ti1">5. Gaspar de Noroña, whose family was of Portuguese
origin, was bred a soldier and served at the siege of Gibraltar, where
he wrote an elegy on the death of Cadahalso (Poesías de Noroña, Madrid,
1799-1800, 2 tom. 12mo, Tom. II. p. 190). He rose in the army to be a
lieutenant-general, and, while holding that rank, published his Ode on
the Peace of 1795, (Tom. I. p. 172,) by which he was first publicly
known as a poet, and which, except, perhaps, a few of his shorter and
lighter poems, is the best of his works. Afterwards he was sent as
ambassador to Russia, but returned to defend his country when it was
invaded by the French, and was made governor of Cadiz. He died in 1815,
(Fuster, Biblioteca, Tom. II. p. 381,) and in 1816 his epic, entitled
“Ommiada,” was published at Madrid, in two volumes, 12mo, containing
above fifteen thousand verses; as dull, perhaps, as any of the similar
poems that abound in Spanish literature, but less offensive to good
taste than most of them. In 1833, there appeared at Paris his “Poesías
Asiáticas puestas en Verso Castellano,” translations from the Arabic,
Persian, and Turkish, made, as he says in the Preface, to give him
poetical materials for his epic. His “Quicaida,” a heroi-comic poem,
in eight cantos, filled with parodies, is very tedious. It is in his
Poesías, printed in 1800.</p>

hundred octave stanzas, I do not know; but I have a poor attempt with
the same title, professing to be the work of Manuel Perez Valderrabano,
(Palencia, 1786, 12mo,) and to have been written for such a prize, to
all the conditions of which the poem of Melendez seems conformed. No
adjudication of the prize, however, took place.</p>

substantial; and, from the same poverty, his burial was so obscure that
the Duke of Frias and the poet Juan Nicasio Gallego with difficulty
discovered his remains, in 1828, and caused them to be respectfully
interred, in one of the principal cemeteries of Montpellier, with an
appropriate monument to mark the spot. Semanario Pintoresco, 1839, pp.

Madrid, 1785, 12mo; 1797, 3 tom. 18mo; 1820, 4 tom. 8vo; the last
with a Life, by Quintana. (Puybusque, Tom. II. p. 496.) I have seen
it stated, that three counterfeit editions of the first small volume,
printed in 1785, appeared almost at the same time with the true one;
so great was the first outbreak of his popularity. The first volume of
Hermosilla (Juicio Crítico de los Principales Poetas Españoles de la
Ultima Era, Paris, 1840, 2 tom. 12mo) contains a criticism of the poems
of Melendez, so severe that I find it difficult to explain its motive.
The judgment of Martinez de la Rosa, in the notes to his didactic poem
on Poetry, is much more faithful and true. Melendez corrected his verse
with great care; sometimes with too much, as may be seen by comparing
some of the poems as he first published them, in 1785, with their last
revision, in the edition of his Works, 1820.</p>

Don Gaspar Melchior de Jovellanos,” Madrid, 1830-32, 7 tom. 8vo. A
declamatory prose satire on the state of Spain in the time of Charles
IV., supposed to have been delivered in the Amphitheatre of Madrid,
in 1796, has been attributed to Jovellanos. It is entitled “Pan y
Toros,” or Bread and Bull-fights, from the old Roman cry of “Panem et
Circenses,” and was suppressed as soon as it was published, but has
often been printed since. Among other distinctions, it enjoyed the
singular one of being translated and privately printed, in 1813, on
board a British man-of-war, stationed in the Mediterranean. But it
is not the work of Jovellanos, though it has almost always borne his
name on the successive editions. Jovellanos was familiar with English
literature, and translated the first book of the “Paradise Lost,” but
not very successfully. For notices of him, see Memorias de Jovellanos,
por Don Agustin Cean Bermudez, Madrid, 1814, 12mo; the Life at the end

and Llorente, Tom. II. p. 540, and Tom. IV. p. 122, where are recorded

purpose was “to show how plays are written in the French style.” Plays
arising from the circumstances of the times, and more in the forms and
character of the preceding century, were sometimes represented, but
soon forgotten. Of these, two may be mentioned as curious. The first is
called, like one of Lope’s, “Sueños hay que son Verdades,” an anonymous
drama, beginning with a dream of the king of Portugal and ending with
its partial fulfilment in the capture of Monsanto, by the forces of
Philip V., in 1704. The other is by Rodrigo Pero de Urrutia, entitled
“Rey decretado en Cielo,” and covers a space of above six years, from
the annunciation by Louis XIV. to the Duke of Anjou, in the first
scene, that the will of Charles II. had made him king of Spain, down
to the victory of Almansa, in 1707, which is its catastrophe. Both are
of no value, and represent fairly, I believe, the merit of the few
historical plays produced in the beginning of the eighteenth century,
in Spain.</p>

Españolas de Don Agustin de Montiano y Luyando,” Madrid, 1750, 12mo;
Discurso Segundo, Madrid, 1753, 12mo. They were translated into French
by Hermilly, and an account of them and their author is given in
Lessing’s Werke, (Berlin, 1794, 18mo, Band XXIII. p. 95,) where we
learn, that Montiano was born in 1697, and that he published, in 1729,
“El Robo de Dina,” which seems to have been so much in the tone of a
play with the same title, in the seventeenth volume of Lope de Vega’s
“Comedias,” that I cannot help thinking Montiano, following the fashion
of Cañizares and the other plunderers of the time, was indebted largely
to his great predecessor, the enemy of whose reputation he afterwards
became. The story of Athaulpho is from the Corónica General, Parte II.
c. 22. The “Virginia,” both in its attempt to exhibit Roman manners and
in its poetical power, suffers severely when compared with Alfieri’s
tragedy on the same subject. But the truth is, Montiano was a slavish
imitator of the French school, which he admired so much as to be unable
to comprehend and feel what was best in his own Castilian. In the
“Aprobacion,” which he prefixed to the edition of Avellaneda, published
in 1732, he says, comparing the second part of Don Quixote, by this
pretender, with the true one by Cervantes,—“I think no man of judgment
will give an opinion in favor of Cervantes, if he compares the two
parts together.”</p>

(Madrid, 12mo, 1751) appeared without the name of the translator,

elder, only in the pamphlets in which they were originally published,
and I believe they have never been collected. The “Don Sancho Garcia”
was first printed in 1771, with the name of Juan del Valle, and in
1804 with the name of its author, accompanied the last time by some
unfortunate prose imitations of Young’s “Night Thoughts,” and other
miscellanies, which follow it into the third volume of their author’s
works, 1818. Latre’s <i>rifacimenti</i> are printed in a somewhat showy
style, probably at the expense of the minister of state, Aranda, under
the title of “Ensayo sobre el Teatro Español,” Madrid, 1773, small
folio. Latassa (Bib. Nueva, Tom. V. p. 513) gives some account of their
author, who died in 1792. The “Anzuelo de Fenisa” and the “Estrella
de Sevilla,” as set to the three unities by Trigueros, were printed
both in Madrid and London. Of the last person, Candido M. Trigueros,
it may be added, that he enjoyed a transient reputation in the latter
part of the eighteenth century, and that his principal work, “La
Riada,” in four cantos of irregular verse, (Sevilla, 1784, 8vo,) on a
disastrous inundation of Seville that had just occurred, was demolished
by a letter of Vargas, and a satirical tract which Forner published
under the name of Antonio Varas. I do not know when he died, but an
account of most of his life and many of his works may be found in the
Biblioteca of Sempere y Guarinos, Tom. VI.</p>

It was so popular that it was several times published surreptitiously,
from notes taken in the theatre, and was once turned into bad verse,
before Jovellanos permitted it to appear from his own manuscript. (See
Vol. VII. of his Works, edited by Cañedo.) It is somewhat singular,
that, just about the time the “Delinquente Honrado” appeared in Spain,
Fenouillet published in France a play, yet found in the “Théatre du
Second Ordre,” with the exactly corresponding title of “L’Honnête
Criminel.” But there is no resemblance in the plots of the two

In the Preface, he replies to Signorelli, who, in the seventh chapter
of the ninth book of his “Storia dei Teatri,” makes a rude attack upon
him, chiefly for sundry translations, which La Cruz does not seem to
have printed. The “Coleccion de Sainetes tanto impresos como inéditos
de Don Ramon de la Cruz, con un Discurso Preliminar de Don Agustin
Duran,” etc., was printed at Madrid in 1843, 2 tom. 8vo. A notice of
the life of the author is in Baena, Hijos, etc., Tom. IV., p. 280.</p>

<p class="ti1">At about the same time that Ramon de la Cruz was amusing
the society of Madrid with his popular dramas and farces, Juan Ignacio
Gonzalez del Castillo was equally successful in the same way at Cadiz.
He was, however, little known beyond the limits of Andalusia till 1845,
when Don Adolfo de Castro published, in his native city, a collection
of his “Saynetes,” filling two volumes, 12mo. In the variety of their
tone, in their faithfulness to the national manners, and in the gayety
of their satire, they resemble those of La Cruz; but they are a little

by Domingo Luis de Guevara in three Letters, (Madrid, 1753, 18mo,) to
which a rejoinder by Faustino de Quevedo appeared at Salamanca in 1754,
18mo;—all the names being pseudonymes, and all the discussions more
angry than wise. The publication of the “Teatro” of La Huerta excited
still more discussion. He himself speaks (Escena Hespañola Defendida,
Madrid, 1786, 12mo, p. cliii.) of the “enorme número de folletos” that
appeared in reply to his “Prólogo,” many of which were probably only
circulated in manuscript, according to the fashion of the times, while
others, like those of Cosme Damian, Tomé Cecial (i. e. J. P. Forner),
etc., were printed in 1786, and La Huerta replied to them in his angry
“Leccion Crítica” of the same year. (Sempere, Bib., Tom. III. p. 88.)

Comella and his friends prevented for some time the representation of

<p id="Footnote_389"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_389">[389]</a></span> The war between the Church and
the theatre was kept up during the whole of the eighteenth century,
and till the end of the reign of Ferdinand VII., in the nineteenth.
Not that plays were at any time forbidden effectually throughout the
kingdom, or silenced in the capital, except during some short period
of national anxiety or mourning; but that, at different intervals,—and
especially about the year 1748, when, in consequence of earthquakes at
Valencia, and under the influence of the Archbishop of that city, its
theatre was closed, and remained so for twelve years, (Luis Lamarca,
Teatro de Valencia, Valencia, 1840, 12mo, pp. 32-36,) and about the
year 1754, when Father Calatayud preached as a missionary and published
a book against plays,—there was great excitement on the subject in the
provinces. Ferdinand VI. issued severe decrees for their regulation,
which were little respected, and in different cities and dioceses,
like Lérida, Palencia, Calahorra, Saragossa, Alicant, Córdova, etc.,
they were from time to time, and as late as 1807, under ecclesiastical
influence, and, with the assent of the people, suppressed, and the
theatres shut up. In Murcia, where they seem to have been prohibited
from 1734 to 1789, and then permitted again, the religious authorities
openly resisted their restoration, and not only denied the sacraments
to actors, but endeavoured to deprive them of the enjoyment of some of
the common rights of subjects, such as that of receiving testamentary
legacies. This, however, was an anomalous and absurd state of things,
making what was tolerated as harmless in the capital of the kingdom a
sin or a crime in the provinces. It was a sort of war of the outposts,
carried on after the citadel had been surrendered. Still it had its
effect, and its influence continued to be felt till a new order of
things was introduced into the state generally. Many singular facts in
relation to it may be found scattered through a very ill-arranged book,
written apparently by an ecclesiastic of Murcia, in two volumes quarto,
at different times between 1789 and 1814, in which last year it was
published there, with the title of “Pantoja, ó Resolucion Histórica,
Teológica de un Caso Prático de Moral sobre Comédias”;—Pantoja being
the name of a lady, real or pretended, who had asked questions of
conscience concerning the lawfulness of plays, and who received her
answers in this clumsy way.</p>

<p class="ti1">The state of the theatre, at the end of the eighteenth
and beginning of the nineteenth century, can be well seen in the
“Teatro Nuevo Español,” (Madrid, 1800-1, 5 tom. 12mo,) filled with the
plays, original and translated, that were then in fashion. It contains
a list of such as were forbidden; imperfect, but still embracing
between five and six hundred, among which are Calderon’s “Life is a
Dream,” Alarcon’s “Weaver of Segovia,” and many more of the best dramas
of the old school. Duran, in a note to his Preface to Ramon de la Cruz,
(Tom. I. p. v.,) intimates that this ostracism was in some degree the
result of the influence of those who sustained the French doctrines.</p>

<p class="ti1">The number of plays acted or published between 1700
and 1825, if not to be compared with that of the corresponding period
preceding 1700, is still large. I think that, in the list given by
Moratin, there are about fourteen hundred; nearly all after 1750.</p>

Supplement of 55 pages, dated 1805; both very meagre, compared with
the vast folios of the two preceding centuries, of which that of
1667 fills, with its Supplement, above 1200 pages. But the last of
the race is as bitter as its predecessors, and, by the great number
of French books it includes, shows the quarter from which danger was
chiefly apprehended. To prevent any of this class from escaping, it is
ordered that “all papers, tracts, and books, on the disturbances in
France, which can inspire a spirit of seduction, shall be delivered to
some servant of the Holy Office.” Supplement of 1805, p. 3. Burke’s
“Reflections” are forbidden in the same Index.</p>

<p id="Footnote_391"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_391">[391]</a></span> One of the most odious of the
acts that marked the restoration of Ferdinand VII. related to the war
of the <i>Comuneros</i>, nearly three centuries before. After the execution
of Juan de Padilla and the exile of his noble wife, in 1521, their
house was razed to the ground, and an inscription reproachful to their
memory placed on the spot where it had stood. This the Cortes removed,
and erected in its stead a simple monument in honor of the martyrs.
In 1823, Ferdinand ordered the simple monument of the Cortes to be
destroyed, and replaced the old inscription! But, since that time,
Martinez de la Rosa has erected a nobler monument to their memory in
his “Viuda de Padilla.” See Henri Ternaux, Les Comuneros, Paris, 1834,

<p id="Footnote_395"><span class="label"><a

and the descent of their language from the ancient Iberian, two
references are sufficient for the present purpose. First, “Über
die Cantabrische oder Baskische Sprache,” by Wilhelm von Humboldt,
published as an Appendix to Adelung and Vater’s “Mithridates,” Theil
IV., 1817, 8vo, pp. 275-360. And, second, “Prüfung der Untersuchungen
über die Urbewohner Hispaniens vermittelst der Vaskischen Sprache,”
etc., von W. von Humboldt, 4to, Berlin, 1821. The admirable learning,
philosophy, and acuteness which this remarkable man brought to all
his philological discussions are apparent in these treatises, both of
which are rendered singularly satisfactory by the circumstance, that,
being for some time Prussian Minister at Madrid, he visited Biscay and
studied its language on the spot. The oldest fragment of Basque poetry
which he found, and which is given in the “Mithridates,” (Theil IV. pp.
354-356,) is held by the learned of Biscay to be nearly or quite as old
as the time of Augustus, to whose Cantabrian war it refers; but this
can hardly be admitted, though it is no doubt earlier than any thing
else we have of the Peninsular literature. It is an important document,
and is examined with his accustomed learning and acuteness by Fauriel,
“Hist. de la Gaule Méridionale,” 1836, 8vo, Tom. II. App. iii. I do
not speak of a pleasant treatise, “De la Antiguedad y Universalidad
del Bascuense en España,” which Larramendi published in 1728, nor of
the Preface and Appendix to his “Arte de la Lengua Bascongada,” 1729;
nor of Astarloa’s “Apologia,” 1803; nor of Erro’s “Lengua Primitiva,”
1806, and his “Mundo Primitivo,” an unfinished work, 1815; for they
all lack judgment and precision. If, however, any person is anxious to
ascertain their contents, a good abstract of the last two books, with
sufficient reference to the first, was published in Boston, by Mr. G.
Waldo Erving, formerly American Minister at Madrid, with a preface and
notes, under the title of “The Alphabet of the Primitive Language of
Spain,” 1829. But Humboldt is to be considered the safe and sufficient
authority on the whole subject, for though Astarloa’s work is not
without learning and acuteness, yet, as both he and his follower, Erro,
labor chiefly to prove, as Larramendi had done long before, that the
Basque is the original language of the whole human race, they are led
into a great many whimsical absurdities, and must be considered, on the
whole, any thing but safe guides.</p>

languages of the Spanish Peninsula, I have confined myself to the known
facts of the case, without entering into the curious speculations to
which these facts have led inquisitive and philosophical minds. But
those who are interested in such inquiries will find abundant materials
for their study in the remarkable “Researches into the Physical History
of Mankind, by Dr. J. C. Prichard,” 5 vols. 8vo, London, 1836-47;
and in the acute “Report” of the Chevalier Bunsen to the Seventeenth
Meeting of the British Association, London, 1848, pp. 254-299. If we
follow their theories, the Basque may be regarded as the language of a
race that came originally from the northern parts of Asia and Europe,
and to which Prichard gives the name of Ugro-Tartarian, while the
Celtic language is that of the oldest of the great emigrations from the
more southern portions of Asia, which Bunsen calls the Japhetic.</p>

perhaps, be taken from Mariana, (Lib. I. c. 15,) who gives the story
as it has come down through tradition, fable, and history, with no
more critical acumen than is common with the Spanish historians. But
such separate facts as are mentioned by Livy (Lib. XXXIV. c. 10, 46,
Lib. XL. c. 43, with the notes in Drakenborch) bring with them a more
distinct impression of the immense wealth obtained anciently from Spain
than any general statements whatever; even more than those of Strabo,
Diodorus, etc. It has been supposed by Heeren, and by others before and
since, (Ideen, 1824, Band I. Theil ii. p. 68,) that the Tarshish of the
Prophets Ezekiel (xxvii. 12) and Isaiah (lx. 8, 9) was in Spain, and
was, in fact, the ancient Tartessus; but this is denied, (Memorias de
la Academia de la Historia, Tom. III. p. 320,) and, no doubt, if the

not been thought necessary here to speak. Their few establishments
were on the southern coast, and rather on the eastern part of it; but
they were of little consequence, and do not seem to have produced any
lasting effect on the character or language of the country. They were,
in fact, rather a result of the influence of the rich and cultivated
Greek colony in the South of France, whose capital seat was Marseilles,
or of the spirit which in Rhodes and elsewhere sent out adventurers
to the far west. (See Benedictins, Hist. Litt. de la France, 1733,
4to, Tom. I. pp. 71, etc.) For those who are curious about the Greeks
in Spain, more than they will probably desire will be found in the
elaborate and clumsy work of Masdeu, Hist. Crit. de España, Tom. I.
p. 211, Tom. III. pp. 76, etc. Aldrete (Orígen de la Lengua Española,
1674, f. 65) has collected about ninety Spanish words to which he
attributes a Greek origin; but nearly all of them may be easily traced
through the Latin, or else they belong to the Northern invaders or to
Italy. Marina, a good authority on this particular point, says: “I
do not deny, nor can it be doubted, that, in the Spanish language,
are found many words purely Greek, and occasional phrases and turns
of expression that are in Attic taste; but this is because they had
first been adopted by the Latin language, which is the mother of
ours.” Mem. de la Real Acad., Tom. IV., Ensayo, etc., p. 47. There is
a curious inscription in Nunes de Lião, (Origem da Lingoa Portugesa,
Lisboa, 1784, p. 32,) from a temple erected by Greeks at Ampurias to
Diana of Ephesus, which states, that “nec relicta Græcorum lingua,
nec <i>idiomate</i> patriæ Iberæ recepto, in mores, in <i>linguam</i>, in jura,
in ditionem cessere <i>Romanam</i>, M. Cathego et L. Apronio Coss.” No
doubt, these Greeks came from Marseilles, or were connected with it;
and no doubt they spoke Latin. But the ancient Iberian language seems
to be recognized as existing, also, among them. Ampurias, however,
was generally in Spain held to be of Greek origin, as we may see in
different ways, and among the rest in the following lines of Espinosa,
who, when Alambron comes there with the Infanta Fenisa, says:—</p>

the accounts are abundant. The first book, however, of Antonio’s

written, it has always seemed singular to me that Horace should
have used exactly the word <i>peritus</i>, when intending specifically
to characterize the Spaniards of his time, (II. Od. xx. 19,) unless
<i>peritus</i> is used with reference to its relations with <i>experior</i>,
rather than in its usual sense of <i>learned</i>. Sir James Mackintosh,

exercised the profession of a rhetorician at Rome, shows pleasantly
that there was no Spanish language at that time (circa A. D. 200)
except the Latin; for when the “Greci plusculi” at table reproached
Antoninus with the poverty of Latin literature, they reproached him as
one who was a party concerned, and he defended himself just as a Roman
would have done, by quotations from the Latin poets. His patriotism was
evidently Roman, and the <i>patria lingua</i> which he vindicated was the
Latin.</p>

<p id="Footnote_415"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_415">[415]</a></span> One reason why the clergy did
little to preserve the purity of the Latin, and much to corrupt it,
in the South of Europe, was, that they were obliged to hold their
intercourse with the common people in the <i>degraded</i> Latin. And this
intercourse, which consisted chiefly of instructions given to the
common people, was a large part of all the clergy did in the early
ages of the Church. For the Christian clergy in Spain, as elsewhere,
addressed themselves, for a long period, to the lower and more ignorant
classes of society, because the refined and the powerful refused to
listen to them. But the Latin spoken by those classes in Spain, whether
it were what was called the “lingua rustica” or not, was undoubtedly
different from the purer Latin spoken by the more cultivated and
favored classes, just as it was in Italy, and even much more than it
was there. In addressing the common people, their Christian teachers
in Spain, therefore, very early found it expedient, and probably
necessary, to use the <i>degraded</i> Latin, which the common people spoke.
At last, as we learn, no other was intelligible to them; for the
grammatical Latin, even of the office of the Mass, ceased to be so. In
this way, Christianity must have contributed directly and materially to
the degradation of the Latin, and to the formation of the new dialects,
just as it contributed to form the modern character, as distinguished
from the ancient. Indeed, without entering into the much vexed
questions concerning the <i>lingua rustica</i> or <i>quotidiana</i>, its origin,
character and prevalence, I cannot help saying, that I am persuaded the
modern languages and their dialects in the South of Europe were, so
far as the Latin was concerned, formed out of the popular and vulgar
Latin found in the mouths of the common people; and that Christianity,
more than any other single cause, was the medium and means by which
this change from one to the other was brought about. For the <i>lingua
rustica</i>, see Morhof, De Patavinitate Livianâ, capp. vi., vii., and
ix.; and Du Cange, De Causis Corruptæ Latinitatis, §§ 13-25, prefixed
to his Glossarium.</p>

“Etymologiarum Libri XX.,” and his “De Summo Bono, Libri III.,” fol.,
1483, lit. Goth. No doubt, there are many words in Isidore of Seville,
that are not of classical authority, some of which he marks as such,
and others not; but, on the whole, his Latinity is respectable. Among
the corrupt words he uses are a few that are curious, because they have
descended into the modern Castilian; such as, “<i>astrosus</i>, ab astro
dictus, quasi malo sidere natus,” (Etymol., 1483, fol. 50. a,) which
appears in the present <i>astroso</i>, the familiar term for <i>unhappy</i>,
<i>disastrous</i>, and permitted by the Spanish Academy;—<i>cortina</i>, of which
Isidore says, “Cortinæ sunt aulæa, id est, vela de pellibus, qualia in
Exodo leguntur,” (Etym., f. 97. b,) which appears in the modern Spanish
<i>cortina</i>, for curtain;—”<i>camisias</i> vocamus, quod in his dormimus
in camis,” (Etym., f. 96. b,) which last word, <i>cama</i>, is explained
afterwards to be “lectus brevis et circa terram,” (Etym., f. 101. a,)
and both of which are now Spanish, <i>camisa</i> being the proper word for
shirt, and <i>cama</i> for bed;—”<i>mantum</i> Hispani vocant quod manus tegat
tantum, est enim brevis amictus,” (Etym., f. 97. a,) which is the
Spanish <i>manto</i>;—and so on with a few others. They are, however, only
curious as corrupted Latin words, which <i>happened</i> to continue in use,
till the modern Spanish arose several centuries later.</p>

not used by the Goths, as well as by the other Northern tribes, in the
fifth century, as they have been ever since. See Ulfilas, Gothische

from 999 to 1003, and was the first head France gave to the Church. I
am aware that the Benedictines (Hist. Litt. de la France, Tom. VI. p.

aware, too, that Andres (Tom. I. pp. 175-178) is unwilling to allow him
to have studied at any schools in Seville and Córdova except Christian
schools. But there is no pretence that the Christians had important
schools in Andalusia at that time, though the Arabs certainly had; and
the authorities on which Andres relies assume that Gerbert studied with
the Moors, and prove more, therefore, than he wishes to be proved. Like
many other men skilled in the sciences during the Middle Ages, Gerbert
was considered a necromancer. A good account of his works is in the

for our purpose, from many passages in Conde, e. g. Tom. I. pp. 39,
82, etc. But after all, perhaps, the reluctant admissions of Florez,
Risco, etc., in the course of the forty-five volumes of the “España
Sagrada,” are quite as good a proof of the tolerance exercised by the
Moors, as the more direct statements taken from the Arabian writers.
See, for Toledo, Florez, Tom. V. pp. 323-329; for Complutum or Alcalá
de Henares, Tom. VII. p. 187; for Seville, Tom. IX. p. 234; for Córdova

p. 203, and Tom. XXXI. pp. 112-117; for Leon, Tom. XXXIV. p. 132; and
so on. Indeed, there is something in the accounts of a great majority
of the churches, whose history these learned men have given in so
cumbrous a manner, that shows the Moors to have practised a toleration
which, <i>mutatis mutandis</i>, they would have been grateful to have found
among the Christians in the time of Philip III.</p>

<p class="mt1">But, amidst the other rare learning of his notes on “The
Mohammedan Dynasties of Spain,” (4to, London, 1840, Vol. I. pp. 419,
420,) Don Pascual de Gayangos has perhaps settled this vexed, though
not very important, question. <i>Mozárabe</i>, or <i>Muzárabe</i>, as he explains
it, “is the Arabic <i>Musta’rab</i>, meaning a man who tries to imitate
or to become an Arab in his manners and language, and who, though he
may know Arabic, speaks it like a foreigner.” The word is still used
in relation to the ritual of some of the churches in Toledo. (Castro,
Biblioteca, Tom. II. p. 458, and Paleographía Esp., p. 16.) On the
other hand, the Moors who, as the Christian conquests were advanced
towards the South, remained, in their turn, inclosed in the Christian
population and spoke or assumed its language, were originally called
<i>Moros Latinados</i>. See “Poema del Cid,” v. 266, and “Crónica General,”
(ed. 1604, fol. 304. a,) where, respecting Alfaraxi, a Moor, afterwards
converted, and a counsellor of the Cid, it is said he was “de tan buen
entendimento, e era <i>tan ladino</i> que semejava Christiano.”</p>

a defence of the fanatical martyrs of Córdova, who suffered under
Abderrahman II. and his son. The passage referred to, with all its sins
against pure Latinity and good taste, is as follows:—“Heu, proh dolor!
linguam suam nesciunt Christiani, et linguam propriam non advertunt
Latini, ita ut omni Christi collegio vix inveniatur unus in milleno
hominum numero, qui salutatorias fatri possit rationabiliter dirigere
literas. Et reperitur absque numero multiplex turba, qui eruditè
Caldaicas verborum explicet pompas. Ita ut metricè eruditiori ab
ipsis gentibus carmine et sublimiori pulchritudine,” etc. It is found
at the end of the treatise, which is printed entire in Florez (Tom.
XI. pp. 221-275). The phrase <i>omni Christi collegio</i> is, I suppose,
understood by Mabillon, “De Re Diplomaticâ,” (fol., 1681, Lib. II. c.
1, p. 55,) to refer to the clergy, in which case the statement would be
much stronger, and signify that “not one <i>priest</i> in a thousand could
address a common letter of salutation to another” (Hallam, Middle Ages,
London, 8vo, 1819, Vol. III. p. 332);—but I incline to think that it
refers to the whole body of Christians in and about Córdova.</p>

important to our purpose. The fact of the translation is in the Crónica
General (Parte III. c. 2, f. 9, ed. 1604): “Trasladó las sanctas
Escripturas en Arávigo e fizó las exposiciones dellas segun conviene
a la sancta Escriptura.” And Mariana gives the true reason for it:
“A causa que la lengua Arábiga se usaba mucho entre todos; la Latina
ordinariamente ni se usaba, <i>ni se sabia</i>.” (Lib. VII. c. iii., <i>prope

<p id="Footnote_452"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_452">[452]</a></span> The Avilés document is regarded
by all who have noticed it as of great importance for the earliest
history of the Castilian. It is first mentioned, I believe, by Father
Risco, in his “Historia de la Ciudad y Corte de Leon” (Madrid, 1793,
4to, Tom. I. pp. 252, 253); and next by Marina, in his “Ensayo”
(Memorias de la Acad. de Historia, Tom. IV., 1805, p. 33);—both
competent witnesses, and both entirely satisfied that it is genuine.
Risco, however, printed no part of it, and Marina published only a few
extracts. But in the “Revista de Madrid,” (Segunda Epoca, Tom. VII. pp.
267-322,) it is published entire, as part of an interesting discussion
concerning the old codes of the country, by Don Rafael Gonzalez
Llanos, a man of learning and a native of Avilés, who seems to have
a strong love for the place of his birth and to be familiar with its
antiquities.</p>

<p class="ti1">The document in question belongs to the class of
instruments sometimes called “Privilegios,” and sometimes “Foros,”
or “Fueros” (see, <i>ante</i>, Vol. I. p. 47, note 28); but where, as in
this case, the authority of the instrument is restricted to a single
town or city, it is more properly called “Carta Puebla,” or municipal
charter. This Carta Puebla of Avilés contains a royal grant of rights
and immunities to the several citizens, as well as to the whole
municipality, and involves whatever regarded the property, business,
and franchises of all whom it was intended to protect. Charters, which
were so important to the welfare of many persons, but which still
rested on the arbitrary authority of the crown, were, as we have
previously said, (Vol. I. p. 47, note 27,) confirmed by succeeding
sovereigns, as often as their confirmation could conveniently
be procured by the communities so deeply interested in their
preservation.</p>

<p class="ti1">The Carta Puebla of Avilés was originally granted by
Alfonso VI., who reigned from 1073 to 1109. It was, no doubt, written
in such Latin as was then used; and in 1274 it was formally made known
to Alfonso the Wise, that it had been burnt during the attack on that
city by his son Sancho. The original, therefore, is lost, and we know
how it was lost.</p>

<p class="ti1">What we possess is the translation of this Carta Puebla,
made when it was confirmed by Alfonso VII., A. D. 1155. It is still
preserved in the archives of the city of Avilés, on the original
parchment, consisting of two skins sewed together,—the two united
being about four feet and eleven inches long, and about nineteen
inches wide. It bears the known seal of Alfonso VII., and the original
signatures of several persons who were bound to sign it with him, and
several subsequent confirmations, scattered over five centuries. (See
Revista, <i>ut sup.</i>, pp. 329, 330.) So that in all respects, including
the coarseness of the parchment, the handwriting, and the language, it
announces its own genuineness with as much certainty as any document of
its age. As printed, it fills about twelve pages in octavo, and enables
us to judge somewhat of the state of the Castilian at the time it was
written.</p>

<p class="ti1">After a caption or enrolment in bad Latin, it opens with
these words:—</p>

<p class="ti1">“Estos sunt los foros que deu el rey D. Alfonso
ad Abilies cuando la poblou par foro Sancti Facundi et otorgo lo
emperador. Em primo, per solar pinder, I solido a lo reu et II denarios
a lo saion, é cada ano un sólido en censo per lo solar: é qui lo
vender, de I solido á lo rai, é quil comparar dará II denarios a lo
saion,” etc. p. 267.</p>

<p class="ti1">A part of one of its important regulations is as
follows:—“Toth homine qui populador for ela villa del rey, de quant
aver qui ser aver, si aver como heredat, dè fer en toth suo placer de
vender o de dar, et á quen lo donar que sedeat stabile si filio non
aver, et si filio aver del, delo á mano illo quis quiser é fur placer,
que non deserede de toto, et si toto lo deseredar, toto lo perdan
aquellos á quen lo der.” Revista, p. 315.</p>

<p class="ti1">Its concluding provisions are in these words:—“Duos
homines cum armas derumpent casa, et de rotura de orta serrada,
LX. sólidos al don de la orta, el medio al rei, é medio al don
dela.—Homines populatores de Abilies, non dent portage ni rivage, desde
la mar ata Leon.” Ibid., p. 322.</p>

<p class="ti1">It ends with bad Latin, denouncing excommunication on
any person who shall attempt to infringe its provisions, and declaring
him “cum Datam et Abiron in infernum damnatus.” Ibid., p. 329.</p>

<p class="ti1">By the general consent of those who have examined it,
this Carta Puebla of Avilés is determined to be the oldest document now
known to exist in the Castilian or vulgar dialect of the period, which
dialect, in the opinion of Don Rafael Gonzalez Llanos, received its
essential character as early as 1206, or six years before the decisive
battle of the Navas de Tolosa, (see, <i>ante</i>, Vol. I. p. 9, note,)
though not a few documents, after that date, abound in Latin words and
phrases. Revista, <i>ut supra</i>, Tom. VIII. p. 197.</p>

<p class="ti1">I am aware that two documents in the Spanish language,
claiming to be yet older, have been cited by Mr. Hallam, in a note to
Part II. c. 9 of his Middle Ages, London, 1819, 8vo, Vol. III. p. 554,
where he says: “The earliest Spanish that I remember to have seen is an
instrument in Martene, Thesaurus Anecdotorum, Tom. I. p. 263; the date
of which is 1095. Persons more conversant with the antiquities of that
country may possibly go farther back. Another of 1101 is published in
Marina’s Teoria de las Cortes, Tom. III. p. 1. It is in a Vidimus by
Peter the Cruel, and cannot, I presume, have been a translation from
the Latin.” There can be no higher general authority than Mr. Hallam
for any historical fact, and this statement seems to carry back the
oldest authentic date for the Spanish language sixty years earlier
than I have ventured to carry it. But I have examined carefully both
of the documents to which Mr. Hallam refers, and am satisfied they are
of later date than the charter of Avilés. That in Martene is merely
an anecdote connected with the taking of “the city of Exea,” when it
was conquered, as this story states, by Sancho of Aragon. Its language
strongly resembles that of the “Partidas,” which would bring it down
to the middle of the thirteenth century; but it bears, in truth, no
date, and only declares at the end that the city of Exea was taken on
the nones of April, 1095, from the Moors. Of course, there is some
mistake about the whole matter, for Sancho of Aragon, here named as its
conqueror, died June 4th, 1094, and was succeeded by Peter I., and the
person who wrote this account, which seems to be, after all, only an
extract from some monkish chronicle, did not live near enough to that
date to know so notorious a fact. Moreover, Exea is in Aragon, where it
is not probable the earliest Castilian was spoken or written. Thus much
for the document from Martene. That from Marina’s Teoria is of a still
later and quite certain date. It is a charter of privileges granted by
Alfonso VI. to the Mozárabes of Toledo, but translated in 1340, when
it was confirmed by Alfonso XI. Indeed, it is so announced by Marina
himself, who in the table of contents says especially, that it is
“<i>translated</i> into Castilian.”</p>

<p id="Footnote_454"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_454">[454]</a></span> The most striking proof, perhaps,
that can be given of the number of Latin words and constructions
retained in the modern Spanish, is to be found in the many pages of
verse and prose that have, from time to time, been so written that
they can be read throughout either as Latin or as Spanish. The first
instance of this sort that I know of is by Juan Martinez Siliceo,
Archbishop of Toledo and preceptor to Philip II., who, when he was in
Italy, wrote a short prose dissertation that could be read in both
languages, in order to prove to some of his learned friends in that
country that the Castilian of Spain was nearer to the Latin than
their Italian;—a <i>jeu-d’esprit</i>, which he printed in his treatise on
Arithmetic, in 1514. (Antonio, Bib. Nov., Tom. II. p. 737.) Other
examples occur afterwards. One may be found in a Spanish Grammar,
published at Louvain in 1555, and entitled “Util y Breve Institution
para aprender Lengua Hespañola”; a curious book, which treats the
Castilian as only one of several languages then spoken in the Spanish
Peninsula, and says of it, “no es otra cosa que Latin corrupto,”—adding
that many letters had been written in Spanish words that were yet Latin
letters, one of which he proceeds to give in proof. Other examples
occur in a Dialogue by Fern. Perez de Oliva, and an Epistle of Ambrosio
Morales, the historian, printed in 1585, with the works of the first;
in a Sonnet published by Rengifo, in his “Arte Poética,” in 1592; and,
finally, in an excessively rare volume of <i>terza rima</i>, by Diego de
Aguiar, printed in 1621, and entitled “Tercetos <i>en Latin congruo</i> y
puro Castellano,” of which the following is a favorable specimen:—</p>

<div class="poem mt1"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">Scribo historias, graves, generosos</p>
<p class="i2">Spiritus, divinos Heroes puros,</p>

</div></div>

<p class="mt1">Much cannot be said for the purity of either the
Castilian or the Latin in verses like these; but they leave no doubt
of the near relationship of the two. For the proportions of all the
languages that enter into the Spanish, see Sarmiento, Memorias, 1775,

<p class="mt1"><i>Roman paladino</i> means the “plain Romance language,”
<i>paladino</i> being derived, as I think, with Sanchez, from <i>palam</i>,
though Sarmiento (in his manuscript on “Amadis de Gaula,” referred to,
Vol. I. p. 322, note) says, when noticing this line: “Paladino es de
<i>palatino</i> y este es de <i>palacio</i>.” The <i>otro latino</i> is, of course,
the elder Latin, however corrupted. Cervantes uses the word <i>ladino</i> to
mean Spanish, (Don Quixote, Parte I. c. 41, and the note of Clemencin,)
and Dante (Par., III. 63) uses it once to mean <i>plain</i>, <i>easy</i>; both
curious instances of an indirect meaning, forced, as it were, upon
a word. <i>Prosa</i> means, I suppose, <i>story</i>. Biagioli (Ad Purgatorio,
XXVI. 118) says: “<i>Prosa</i> nell’ Italiano e nel Provenzale del secolo
xiii. significa precisamente <i>istoria o narrazione in versi</i>.” It may
be doubted whether he is right in applying this remark to the passage
in Dante, but it is no doubt applicable to the passage before us in
Berceo, the meaning of which both Bouterwek and his Spanish translators
have mistaken. (Bouterwek, Trad. Cortina, etc., 8vo, Madrid, 1829, Tom.
I. pp. 60 and 119.) Ferdinand Wolf (in his very learned work, “Über die
Lais, Sequenzen und Leiche,” Heidelberg, 1841, 8vo, pp. 92 and 304)
thinks the use of the word <i>prosa</i>, here and elsewhere in early Spanish
poetry, had some reference to the well-known use of the same word in
the offices of the Church. (Du Cange, Glossarium, <i>ad verb</i>.) But I
think the early Spanish rhymers took it from the Provençal, and not
from the ecclesiastical Latin.</p>

The two lines signify that “works of charity performed in a lukewarm

cancelled in my copy of the first edition. Cervantes, therefore, did
not, after all, stand on so safe ground as he thought he did, when, in
c. 20 of the same Part, he says his Don Quixote “does not contain even
a thought that is not strictly Catholic.”</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
